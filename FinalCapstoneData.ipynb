       "'Photo: Julie Leopo/EdSource  Photo: Julie Leopo/EdSource  Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency on Wednesday after an elderly patient in Placer County, near Sacramento, died from the coronavirus. The latest developments heighten the urgency for education leaders in California, who have been exploring how to continue instruction in case of an outbreak.  No California children have been diagnosed with the virus, a respiratory illness that began with an outbreak in Wuhan, China. Risk is still low across the state, California health officials said on Wednesday, and it is believed to be higher for older adults and persons with underlying health conditions, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  How California schools prepare for the potential impact of the virus, which might lead to quarantines that affect student learning and well-being, is top of mind among parents and district officials across the state.  “It’s natural to feel concerned about the novel coronavirus,” said Mark Ghaly, secretary for the California Health and Human Services Agency, at a public briefing on Wednesday. “This is a rapidly evolving situation.”  “Clearly everybody is concerned and worried,” said Robert Collier, a parent of a 4th-grade student at Sylvia Mendez Elementary School in Berkeley Unified and president of the Berkeley PTA Council. Berkeley had its first case of coronavirus — an unidentified adult resident — reported on Tuesday.  But moving to the step of widespread school shutdowns could have devastating impacts on families, Collier said. “Most people still go into work. Most people don’t have the capacity to take care of kids during the day. It would be incredibly disruptive for people’s work lives and private lives. It would be no small thing.”  Aspire Monarch Academy, a charter school in Oakland, announced on Thursday that it will close through Friday because a staff member was potentially exposed to coronavirus. Lowell High School in San Francisco Unified, which has an enrollment of about 2,270, also closed on Thursday because a relative of a student is being treated for coronavirus.  Two private schools, the Healdsburg School in Sonoma County and Menlo School in San Mateo County, so far are the only California schools that have closed due to concerns about coronavirus. Healdsburg School has since reopened, while Menlo School plans to remain closed through the weekend.  Action Day Primary Plus, a private preschool operator in San Jose, closed its Moorpark location on Thursday for deep cleaning after learning a teacher tested positive for coronavirus. The school will remain closed through the week, and the other nine Action Day Primary Plus schools will remain open.  In Palo Alto Unified, two students were sent home Friday after district officials learned that their parent may have been exposed to someone with the virus, also known as COVID-19. Palo Alto Unified has no plans to close schools at this point and is not providing online instruction to students whose parents might choose to keep their children at home.  Health and education officials are now telling schools to prepare if students and teachers must stay home. Schools that do close have been advised to “implement e-learning plans, including digital and distance learning options as feasible and appropriate,” according to guidance from the Centers for Disease Control. The California Department of Education is encouraging districts to follow guidance from the California Department of Public Health and the Centers for Disease Control.  Some districts are now discussing how technology can help keep lessons going if students must stay home. But in many districts, especially those in rural areas, students may lack the computers and internet at home needed for online learning. Simply turning in digital assignments can be prohibitive for students without internet at home.  Only about a third of California households in rural areas are subscribed to internet service, compared with 78 percent in urban areas, according to an EdSource analysis last year of data from the California Public Utilities Commission.  “I think it would be a mistake for school districts, including PAUSD, to prematurely commit to online instruction for all students,” said Palo Alto Unified superintendent Don Austin. “I would be concerned about teacher training, student access to connectivity and devices, school district tools, accounting of instructional minutes and a myriad of other considerations.”  In Paradise Unified in Butte County, officials are beginning to discuss their learning contingency plan.  The district has been here before: The 2018 Camp Fire, the most destructive in California’s history, forced schools in Paradise to close as families were displaced. While schools remained closed, the district kept some lessons going for students in grades 7 to 12. The district used an online learning program called Edmentum, and other tools like Google Classroom, which teachers in the district already have access to and can use to create digital assignments.  But even before the Camp Fire, officials say ensuring every student has access to the internet and computers at home has been difficult in Paradise, a small rural town.  “Not having devices is always a stumbling block to online learning,” Superintendent Tom Taylor said. But online learning isn’t off the table for Paradise. During the fires, the district issued devices and mobile WiFi routers to students who didn’t have access already. Taylor said the district could do that again.  Share Your Thoughts How is your school preparing for coronavirus? The EdSource team would like to get a better understanding of how schools, colleges and early education/child care centers are preparing for possible outbreaks of the new coronavirus in their communities. We’d appreciate hearing from you. Fill out our form here.  Other education experts say many schools lack the tools and training needed to successfully switch from an in-person school system to temporarily delivering instruction online. Teachers and students must first know how to use online teaching platforms. Then there’s the added challenge of creating a digital learning environment that is engaging for students who are used to asking questions and working face-to-face.  “There are a million reasons why this won’t work. Think about child care. Schools give students a safe space during the day when often both caregivers are off working and doing something else,” said Tanner Higgins, a director at Common Sense Media, a nonprofit based in San Francisco that advocates for safe technology use for children and their families.  Some districts without the capacity to continue learning during a school closure are making other plans, such as adding instructional days to the end of the school calendar. South Pasadena Unified School District sent parents an email on Wednesday telling parents it does not have the infrastructure to offer distance learning for all students and to begin planning for the possibility that schools might close.  Illness-related school closures are rare in California.  There were only 72 emergency school closure days due to infectious diseases between 2002 and 2018, CalMatters reported, compared with thousands of days schools closed due to wildfires and natural disasters. Administrators should work with local health officials when making decisions about school dismissal or large event cancellations, according to the Centers for Disease Control.  Across the state, K-12 administrators have sent out emails and social media posts saying they are reviewing emergency plans and have asked parents to take precautions similar to those advised during flu season. Many are also ramping up cleaning and disinfecting protocols. Officials in Palo Alto Unified said Monday that additional cleaning crews worked at both Palo Alto High School and JLS Middle School over the weekend.  Districts near Solano County, where one of the earliest cases of the virus was reported in California, are also offering short-term independent study for some families. Los Angeles Unified similarly advised schools to “help minimize the impact on the student’s academic success, and offer opportunities for the students to study independently at their home or a quarantine location,” if a student is required to stay home due to coronavirus concerns.  In Berkeley Unified, district leaders met on Tuesday to refine their emergency response. If someone at one of its schools comes in contact with the virus, the district plans to contact local health agencies for guidance on whether to send the person home and if school closure is necessary. The district plans to continue communicating with school staff and families on any updates, such as if someone at a school had been exposed to the virus and advising on best practices to stay healthy.  But officials are still unclear what the best response will be to continue learning during an outbreak.  “It’s no small task to develop an online learning program on the fly,” said Trish McDermott, public information officer at Berkeley Unified. “We have families who are homeless or don’t have technology at home. That creates an equity issue for students where it might be possible.”  The district is looking into less formal remote learning options, such as Khan Academy, a website that offers free video lessons and tutorials for students, and how schools and families might utilize the local library.  “I think the district is being as forthcoming and communicative as it can, but of course nobody has a crystal ball. How bad is this going to get? Will it become a pandemic? Nobody knows,” Collier said.  The number of cases of the coronavirus reported in the U.S. remains low — 152 as of Wednesday afternoon, and 11 deaths. State officials said 53 individuals in California have been confirmed with the virus as of Wednesday.  Several counties have issued states of emergency, including San Francisco and Los Angeles, where seven cases have been confirmed. Two new cases of the virus were confirmed on Monday in Santa Clara County, bringing the county’s total to nine.  As school officials rush to get the latest updates and pull together emergency plans, some online learning services are trying to prepare remote learning alternatives.  One of those services is Scout, a University of California-run program that develops and delivers A-G-approved courses (required for admission to UC and California State University) to students online. California public high schools can use the Scout platform and classes for free. It includes a learning management system that students and teachers use to communicate and submit assignments, course content including video lessons, assignments, tests, and projects, a grade book for teachers, and other online tools.  It’s unclear, however, if the free platform could handle a sharp uptick in users on short notice. Last year, Scout worked with 712 California schools.  “A concern would be if we have enough support,” said Ehren Koepf, executive director of Scout. “If we have a high volume of questions, can my staff answer questions quick enough?”  Meanwhile, parents in Alhambra Unified near Los Angeles have been pressuring district leaders to keep students home, although no cases of coronavirus have been reported in the San Gabriel Valley, where the district is located.  Even in urban and suburban districts like Alhambra Unified, where nearly 64 percent of students receive free or reduced lunch, remote learning will be difficult.  “Two of our challenges will be making sure that students have equitable access to WiFi and laptops,” said Janet Lees, assistant superintendent of educational services for Alhambra Unified. “Another challenge will be making sure we are able to create relevant and effective instruction.”  As districts sort out their capacity to deliver online learning, Taylor, the superintendent in Paradise Unified, said his top concern is students’ emotional well-being during this confusing time.  “If there is to be an outbreak it would really be tough for our community, and any community,” he said. “We are still in recovery mode from the fire, then you get hit with something like this, and it’s another added layer.”  To get more reports like this one, to sign up for EdSource’s no-cost daily email on latest developments in education.'"

       "'California’s first coronavirus fatality — an elderly patient who apparently contracted the illness on a cruise — prompted the governor Wednesday to declare a statewide emergency.  The measure made California the third U.S. state to declare a state of emergency. Washington and Florida are the other two.  The state currently has 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus, including three new cases announced Wednesday in Santa Clara County and a medical screener at Los Angeles International Airport.  Gov. Gavin Newsom said the emergency proclamation is intended to help procure supplies and resources quickly. He announced the move Wednesday afternoon during a news conference, hours after the patient’s death in Placer County was announced.  Newsom said the state is particularly focused on senior centers, nursing homes and other care facilities where people live together in light of the outbreak in Washington state that has already killed 10 there.  Meanwhile, on Thursday, representatives from nurses unions across the state and nation held a news conference in Oakland to speak out on what they\\'re calling hospitals\\' inability to protect nurses and other health care workers during the coronavirus outbreak.  \"Nurses are confident that we can care for COVID-19 patients and even stop the spread of the virus if we are given the protections and resources we need to do our job,\" said Bonnie Castillo, executive director of the California Nurses Association and National Nurses United. \"We\\'re calling on our facilities to follow the precautionary principle, which says we don\\'t wait until we know for sure something is dangerous. … We have to act now.\"  The Grand Princess cruise ship is now under investigation as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probe a “small cluster” of coronavirus patients who were aboard, according to the cruise line. Another passenger who contracted the COVID-19 virus is now in stable condition at a hospital in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco.  The elderly patient had underlying health conditions and died at a hospital in Roseville, near Sacramento, according to Placer County health officials.  The person was not identified, with officials disclosing only that the person was a Placer County resident who tested positive for the virus Tuesday.  Health officials believe both cruise ship patients were exposed while they were on the Grand Princess cruise from San Francisco to Mexico from Feb. 11 to Feb. 21.  Newsom said more than half of 2,500 aboard the February cruise, which docked in San Francisco, are California residents. The governor also added 11 passengers and 10 crew members on the ship are showing symptoms of the virus.  Newsom said California will be flying thousands of test kits out to the ship. The tests can be conducted in a San Francisco Bay Area lab.  “There’s a reason that we didn’t want the ship in the Port of San Francisco and in the state of California at this time,” Newsom said.  The Placer County person had symptoms as early as Feb. 19, according to Placer County Health Officer Aimee Sisson. Emergency personnel were called to the person’s home in Rocklin, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, on Feb. 27, when they were admitted to a hospital.  The cruise ship is at sea but is expected to skip its next port and return to San Francisco by Thursday, according to a statement from Dr. Grant Tarling, the chief medical officer for the Carnival Corp., which operates the Grand Princess. Any current passengers who were also on the February trip will be screened.  Newsom said the cruise ship, with thousands of people aboard, will be held offshore until passengers can be tested.  “The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,” he said.  The CDC is working with California authorities to contact other passengers from the previous trip, CDC Director Robert Redfield said Wednesday at a White House briefing.  “We’re at the very beginning of that, looking at the manifest to make sure that we understand who has gotten off the cruise and where they got off the cruise,” Redfield said.  Governor @GavinNewsom’s statement regarding the death of a Placer County patient who is the first known COVID-19 death in California: pic.twitter.com/ISVm7eQ15R — Office of the Governor of California (@CAgovernor) March 4, 2020  Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, runny nose, cough and breathing trouble. Most develop only mild disease. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.  In all, more than 94,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, with more than 3,200 deaths. WHO reports that the COVID-19 virus is more fatal than the common flu.'"

       "'Three more cases in Santa Clara County were also announced, and the many developments represented a significant escalation of the situation in California, which has had at least 54 cases of the virus, the most of any state. Officials in Los Angeles County — with 10 million residents, the largest county in the nation — declared a state of emergency, warning that the number of confirmed cases was likely to rise.  “This is a call for preparedness,” Dr. Barbara Ferrer, the director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health, said at a news conference on Wednesday. “Know what you might do should we see an explosion of cases.”  While seeking to tamp down public anxieties, officials also warned that a worsening spread of the coronavirus could potentially lead to a grim new reality. Officials could order “extreme measures of social distancing.” Major sporting events could be played without spectators. Schools could shut down.  “This is the time for people to have a plan for what they would do should their child’s school need to close,” Dr. Ferrer said.  Dr. Jonathan Fielding, a public health expert at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that the number of cases in California, a large state that is a frequent entry point for travel from Asia, was likely to rise, particularly as officials increase their capacity to test and diagnose cases.  “What was unfortunately predictable has now come into direct line of consciousness for many people who were hoping it would not happen,” said Dr. Fielding, who previously worked as the public health director for Los Angeles County. He added, “It’s very likely that it’s going to get worse before it gets better.”  The 11 deaths in the United States are a small fraction of the more than 3,000 deaths that have been traced to the virus worldwide. Early estimates of the coronavirus death rate from China, the epicenter of the outbreak, have been around 2 percent. On average, seasonal flu strains kill about 0.1 percent of people who become infected.'"

       "'California\\'s first coronavirus fatality — an elderly patient who apparently contracted the illness on a cruise — prompted the governor Wednesday to declare a statewide emergency as six new cases, including a medical screener at Los Angeles International Airport, were confirmed.  The measure made California the third U.S. state to declare a state of emergency. Washington and Florida are the other two.  The state currently has 53 confirmed cases of coronavirus.  Gov. Gavin Newsom said the emergency proclamation is intended to help procure supplies and resources quickly. He announced the move Wednesday afternoon during a news conference, hours after the patient\\'s death in Placer County was announced.  The cruise ship is now under investigation as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention probe a “small cluster” of coronavirus patients who were aboard, according to the cruise line. Another passenger who contracted the COVID-19 virus is now in stable condition at a hospital in Sonoma County, north of San Francisco.  It was unclear if the airport medical screener contracted through their work at the airport or from so-called community transmission, according to a statement from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. No travelers screened at the Los Angeles airport have tested positive for the virus.  Earlier Wednesday, officials in Los Angeles County announced that six new cases of the coronavirus had been confirmed, up from one previously. The airport screener is one of those six patients.  Across California, more than 50 people have tested positive for the virus, including several who got it through community transmission, according to the state Department of Public Health. More than 500 people have been tested for the virus.  The elderly patient had underlying health conditions and died at a hospital in Roseville, near Sacramento, according to Placer County health officials.  The person was not identified, with officials disclosing only that the person was a Placer County resident who tested positive for the virus Tuesday.  Health officials believe both cruise ship patients were exposed while they were on the Grand Princess cruise from San Francisco to Mexico from Feb. 11 to Feb. 21.  Newsom said more than half of 2,500 aboard the February cruise, which docked in San Francisco, are California residents.  The Placer County person had symptoms as early as Feb. 19, according to Placer County Health Officer Aimee Sisson. Emergency personnel were called to the person\\'s home in Rocklin, about 110 miles (180 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco, on Feb. 27, when they were admitted to a hospital.  The cruise ship is at sea but is expected to skip its next port and return to San Francisco by Thursday, according to a statement from Dr. Grant Tarling, the chief medical officer for the Carnival Corp., which operates the Grand Princess. Any current passengers who were also on the February trip will be screened.  Newsom said the cruise ship, with thousands of people aboard, will be held offshore until passengers can be tested.  “The ship will not come on shore until we appropriately assess the passengers,” he said.  The CDC is working with California authorities to contact other passengers from the previous trip, CDC Director Robert Redfield said Wednesday at a White House briefing.  \"We’re at the very beginning of that, looking at the manifest to make sure that we understand who has gotten off the cruise and where they got off the cruise,” Redfield said.  The airport screener is a contractor for the Department of Homeland Security and wore protective equipment at work, the homeland security statement said. The person is being quarantined at home with mild symptoms.  The patient last worked at the airport on Feb. 21 and began feeling cold-like symptoms on Feb. 29, officals said. The patient’s doctor tested them for coronavirus on March 1.  NBC News first reported the case of the airport screener.  Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, runny nose, cough and breathing trouble. Most develop only mild disease. But some people, usually those with other medical complications, develop more severe symptoms, including pneumonia, which can be fatal.  In all, more than 94,000 people have contracted the virus worldwide, according to the World Health Organization, with more than 3,200 deaths. WHO reports that the COVID-19 virus is more fatal than the common flu.  Los Angeles County health officials expect more cases to be confirmed and have increased the county\\'s capacity to test at a local laboratory.  The cases were from throughout the county, she said, but did not provide specific locations.  Regarding the new cases, officials said three of those who tested positive were travelers together in northern Italy, two were family members who had close contact with another family member who previously tested positive for the virus and the sixth patient is the airport screener.  Officials in Los Angeles County and the city have signed proclamations of local emergencies to aid efforts to respond to the virus and free up resources. Authorities are also assisting shelters to prevent transmission of the virus in the homeless population.  “This is not a response rooted in panic,” Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger said.  __  Associated Press writers Olga R. Rodriguez in San Francisco and Kevin Freking in Washington, D.C., contributed to this report.'"

       "'People who believe they may have coronavirus can get tested for the COVID-19 disease with no out-of-pocket cost, Gov. Gavin Newsom announced on Thursday.  The California Department of Insurance and the Department of Managed Care say 24 million Californians will be eligible for free testing. It means people covered by either private insurance or Medi-Cal plans won’t have to pay for the screening or associated costs like lab work.  \"Californians shouldn\\'t have to fear a big medical bill just because they took a test for COVID-19,\" Newsom said in a statement.  Dr. Mark Ghaly, secretary of the California Health and Human Services Agency, urged people with symptoms, or those who may have encountered someone with the illness, to call their health care provider or local public health official before seeking medical care.  “This doesn’t mean every Californian should be seeking a test,” he said.  The announcement comes a day after Newsom declared a state of emergency in an effort to contain the virus.'"

       "'Note: As of June 13, we are no longer updating this blog. Find the latest coronavirus updates here.  Get Caught Up NATIONAL: The Trump Administration is monitoring travel from Mexico as part of a theory that this could be behind a new wave of coronavirus infections, instead of states’ efforts to reopen economies. The AP reports the notion was discussed during a Thursday meeting of the administration’s coronavirus task force. The Environmental Protection Agency ordered Amazon and eBay to stop selling fake coronavirus-fighting products , including items that have toxic chemicals like chlorine dioxide and methylene chloride. Find the latest coronavirus case counts for California and each county in our COVID-19 tracker here.  Previous Updates  Nail salons, other services can open next week  New city program offers grants to Sacramento restaurants for creating outdoor seating  Sacramento Zoo to reopen Monday  Orange County lifts face coverings requirement  California hotels and zoos welcome back visitors  Friday, June 12  5:29 p.m.: Nail salons, other services can open next week Nail salons, tattoo and piercing shops and skin care services can begin reopening as soon as Friday, June 19. The California Department of Public Health released new guidelines for the industries, some of which require touching a client’s body or face. They can only reopen in counties that meet certain benchmarks set by the state, though all but Imperial and a handful of Bay Area counties have met the requirements. The services are among the last to resume operations since the statewide stay-at-home order was issued on March 19. Skating rinks, live theater, concerts and amusement parks are not permitted to open, and Gov. Gavin Newsom has said crowded events will likely not resume until there is a vaccine or herd immunity from the coronavirus. The guidelines for personal services came out the same day the state allowed bars, gyms, movie theaters and museums to reopen with sanitation and distancing measures. 4:38 p.m.: New city program offers grants to Sacramento restaurants for creating outdoor seating Restaurants in Sacramento are hustling to add more outdoor seating during the pandemic, and the city has announced a grant program to help make the transition more affordable. The program is called \"Farm to Fork Al Fresco,\" a merging of the city\\'s much touted farm-to-table food scene and the Italian word for open-air dining. The goal is to move more restaurant customers outdoors, where medical experts say there\\'s a lower risk of transmitting the coronavirus. The city is offering grants of up to $3,000 for restaurants anywhere in the city. It would reimburse independent or locally owned franchise restaurants for expenses, which could include things like umbrellas and new lighting. The city has a million dollars in federal stimulus funding for the program, and the deadline to apply is July 15.  1:20 p.m.: Sacramento Zoo to reopen Monday You can visit the Sacramento Zoo again starting Monday June 15, but you\\'ll need to make reservations. The zoo closed to the public three months ago because of the coronavirus and government-mandated shutdown orders. It\\'s home to about 500 animals, and Executive Director Jason Jacobs says a lot of them noticed there weren\\'t a lot of people around over the past few months. \"Since we\\'ve been closed, they\\'re very curious and give you more attention when you walk around,\" Jacobs said. To gear up for reopening, Jacobs says the zoo has made several changes intended to limit attendance to help with social-distancing. \"The most important change is that you have to plan your visit, you just can\\'t spontaneously show up anymore. We\\'re doing this because we\\'ve limited the number of people who can be in the zoo at any one time.\" That means you\\'ll need to reserve and buy tickets online. Physical distancing signage will be placed throughout the zoo, face coverings are strongly recommended and there\\'s a new paperless system in place, both for transactions and zoo maps. Some attractions will be closed to help with social distancing, including the Reptile House and playground.  6:50 a.m.: Orange County lifts face coverings requirement  Orange County\\'s interim health officer relaxed the county’s face covering requirement for residents in public.  Dr. Clayton Chau changed the order Thursday to say people should wear face coverings outside their home when they can’t physically distance themselves by at least six feet.  “This change ensures the OC Health Care Agency is acting consistently with our partners at the California Department of Public Health and is based on Orange County’s measures against state-mandated COVID-19 metrics,” Chau said in a press release. “I stand with public health experts and believe strongly that face coverings help slow the spread of COVID-19 and save lives.\"  This change comes three days after the previous health officer resigned after she received threats over her order requiring face coverings as Orange County allowed more businesses to reopen. Residents have railed against the requirement at public meetings.  Similar rules are in place in Los Angeles and San Diego counties. In Riverside County masks are recommended, not required.  6:33 a.m.: California hotels and zoos welcome back visitors  California counties now have the green light to allow hotels, zoos, aquariums, wine tasting rooms and museums to reopen Friday.  But guests will see changes.  Hotels will limit people lounging by pools and attractions will require masks.  Stay-at-home orders are estimated to have cost the state economy some $72 billion in expected revenue from tourism. The $145 billion industry is now trying to balance how to implement safety measures to control a pandemic without ruining the experience for visitors.  Thursday, June 11  4:17 p.m.: Nevada sees rise in new COVID-19 cases, but official says it’s not necessarily a second spike Nevada officials confirmed that the number of new COVID-19 cases has increased in the last week. Caleb Cage, who is in charge of the state’s COVID-19 response, says confirmed cases have been going up for six days in a row. But Cage also said it’s not necessarily a second spike yet. He explained the increased number of cases could be a result of greater testing availability across the state. “We’ve seen a great increase over the last two weeks in the number of community based testing operations that are going on throughout the state, as well as our capacity to analyze those specimens that are collected in community-based testing,” he said. Nevada is nearing the end of the second phase of its reopening plan. If the number of new cases levels off, the state could see more restrictions being rolled back as soon as next week. Nevada has recorded 10,399 positive tests for COVID-19 and the virus is blamed for 458 deaths in the state as of Thursday. 4:01 p.m.: Coachella, Stagecoach music festivals canceled There will be no Frank Ocean at Coachella this year, or Thomas Rhett at Stagecoach. Both music festivals have been canceled due to coronavirus concerns. Riverside County\\'s public health officer signed an order Wednesday to cancel the popular events outside Palm Springs. Health officials are concerned about a possible surge in coronavirus cases in the fall. The festivals are typically held in April but previously were postponed until October. Health officials now say they aren\\'t \"comfortable moving forward.\"  1:12 p.m.: Cal Fire prepares for preventing the spread of COVID-19 while fighting fires Cal Fire is gearing up for wildfire season. But how will the agency handle social distancing and other coronavirus restrictions in the midst of a natural disaster? In an interview on Insight with Beth Ruyak, Cal Fire Director Thom Porter said this is a question the agency has been working through for several months. When firefighters are deployed to a major event, they travel together and stay in base camps where they’re fed together. Porter said that his plan is to double-down on the initial attacks on wildfires, hitting every fire as soon as possible to keep them as small as possible, “so we don\\'t have then that next piece of developing fires that require a large base camp or thousands of firefighters to congregate in order to put the fires out.” Cal Fire is also working with the Red Cross and the state Office of Emergency Services to plan for setting up evacuation centers that follow COVID-19 restrictions when fire danger forces people from their homes. There have only been three confirmed cases of the coronavirus among Cal Fire employees, a department of 7,000, according to Porter.  7:00 a.m. New coronavirus cases at Tesla Fremont plant  Tesla employees say there are new coronavirus cases among co-workers after Elon Musk defied Alameda County health orders and reopened its main production plant in Fremont.  Employees told the Washington Post that they found out about the cases during meetings with supervisors and they confirmed at least two cases at the seat assembly facility near the Fremont plant.  According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Tesla notified the Alameda County Public Health Department about the cases.  “We are working with Tesla to investigate and ensure appropriate public health measures are in place,” said Alameda County Public Health spokeswoman Neetu Balram in an e-mail to the Chronicle.  Tesla has not responded to requests for comments from media organizations.  It is not clear from employees or from the county health department on whether these workers were infected on the job or off site.  6:40 a.m.: State judicial leaders delay vote on ending eviction protections  California judicial leaders delayed a decision on ending statewide emergency orders suspending foreclosures and evictions during the coronavirus pandemic.  State lawmakers meanwhile are scrambling to expand safeguards.  The courts\\' consideration prompted objections from housing advocates who said the move could lead to a wave of renters being forced onto the streets.  Wednesday, June 10  3:52 p.m.: California takes step toward allowing Legislature to vote remotely The California Assembly narrowly passed a proposal to allow state legislators to vote remotely during emergencies. Lawmakers were regretting not being able to take votes during a weeks-long recess amid the pandemic. The measure approved today comes as other states and cities have relaxed rules for voting remotely. The state Senate has until June 25 to pass the proposed constitutional amendment and place it on the November ballot, where voters will have the final say. The Legislature stopped work for the first time in 158 years in the middle of March due to the coronavirus, before resuming committee meetings in early May.  11:44 a.m.: Gov. Newsom defends new reopenings scheduled this weekend As some areas in California report spikes in coronavirus cases and hospitalizations, Gov. Gavin Newsom isn’t backing down from plans to let additional businesses resume operations this weekend. He says testing, personal protective equipment and contact-tracing efforts have ramped up significantly over the course of the state’s battle against the disease. Compared to 90 days ago, “we’re in a completely different place to prepare for an inevitable increase,” Newsom said. “We’ve made it abundantly clear that we anticipate an increase in the total number of positive cases” as new sectors return to work. Gyms, bars, schools, movie theaters and more are being allowed to reopen as soon as Friday with new measures to allow for social distancing and increased sanitation. The governor made the comments Tuesday in Oakland — an area, he pointed out, that has moved at a slower pace to reopen certain parts of the economy than the rest of the state. “I respect the role of local leaders to make that decision on their own terms, based on their own conditions,” he said. Sacramento, San Joaquin, Santa Clara, Fresno and other counties have been placed on a “watch list” by the California Department of Public Health for increased numbers.  7:15 a.m.: Stockton council votes down face covering proposal  Stockton City Council members rejected an emergency ordinance to require masks at stores, retail shops, and workplaces during Tuesday’s meeting.  According to state guidelines for stage 2 of reopening, San Joaquin County needs to show less than 190 coronavirus cases over a 14-day period.  Stockton Mayor Michael Tubbs says the county has seen more than 300 cases in the past two weeks.  He announced the vote last night on social media.  “Every single council member voted against the mask ordinance, although our city hall and city staff follow those guidelines,” Tubbs said on Twitter. “I have serious concerns about our ability to stay open without measures to mitigate the spread, and am disappointed in council’s action tonight.”  California placed San Joaquin County on a state watch list this week after it experienced a spike of COVID-19-related hospitalizations.  6:50 a.m.: State judicial leaders may end eviction protections early  The statewide emergency orders that suspend foreclosures and evictions during the coronavirus pandemic may end early.  The AP reports California’s Judicial Council is set to vote Wednesday on whether to lift the rules as California reduces stay-at-home orders that helped slow the spread of the virus.  Council members delayed all eviction cases in April.  Lawmakers and advocates say the group may be acting too soon and the vote could disproportionately harm minorities in the middle of civil unrest over police violence.  Tuesday, June 9  5:27 p.m.: Yosemite to reopen this week with capacity restrictions Yosemite will reopen with restrictions this week after being closed for more than 2 1/2 months because of the coronavirus outbreak. Officials say the number of visitors admitted to the National Park starting Thursday will be restricted to about half those that normally visit this time of year. In addition some park facilities including campgrounds and visitor centers will remain closed or have limited access to help prevent the spread of the virus. Yosemite had about 4.6 million visitors in 2019. The park was shut down March 20.  3:54 p.m.: Orange County health official resigns, becoming seventh in the state to do so The health officer for Southern California\\'s Orange County has resigned after receiving threats over her order for residents to wear face coverings when near others in public to protect against the coronavirus. Dr. Nichole Quick left her job late Monday. An official with California\\'s public health officers\\' association says Quick is the seventh senior health official in the state to leave her job since the pandemic began. Orange County residents opposed to the mask order protested outside Quick\\'s home and brought a banner to a public meeting that depicted her as a Nazi. — The Associated Press contributed to this report  6:43 a.m. Stockton City Council votes on face covering ordinance Stockton City Council members will consider an ordinance to require everyone to wear face coverings to prevent the spread of COVID-19 during a special session Tuesday. Here’s the recommendation: It is recommended that the City Council adopt an urgency ordinance that requires all members of the public and workers to wear face coverings or masks, covering the mouth and nose, when they need to interact with others outside the home and especially in settings where many people are present to prevent inadvertently spreading COVID-19 in the City of Stockton, and calling on San Joaquin County Public Health Services to require the same measure. On his Facebook page, Mayor Michael Tubbs said San Joaquin County is on a state watch list due to the spike in COVID-19 cases. “I worked to bring testing here and am now proposing the wearing of masks in public so that we are able to keep opening up in a smart way,” Tubbs said on his Facebook page. 6:30 a.m.: Nevada votes by mail for Tuesday primary Nevada is holding its first-ever election almost entirely by mail while accommodating a new law that allows voters to register at the polls. The goal is to keep people safe amid the pandemic. The Secretary of State limited the number of polling places for Tuesday’s primary and sent absentee ballots to voters. The top-ticket races include Nevada\\'s four U.S House members who are all seeking re-election this year. Tuesday’s primary will settle who they face in November.  Monday, June 8  4:48 p.m.: California releases guidelines for reopening schools California\\'s Department of Education has released a detailed how-to guide to safely reopen schools in the age of face masks and physical distancing. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Thurmond says it will serve as a road map for school districts as they prepare for the return of classes. The 55-page manual was released today. Thurmond says many parents have also expressed an interest in continuing online learning, which will be incorporated. Schools throughout California have been closed since mid-March when Governor Gavin Newsom issued a statewide stay-at-home order due to the pandemic.  3:55 p.m.: Stockton offering temporary outdoor seating for restaurants Stockton is giving restaurants more room for social distancing by allowing seating on public sidewalks. The city is offering temporary outdoor dining permits and relaxing its rules on signage so businesses can more easily communicate with their customers. Lisa Whirlow with Whirlows on the Miracle Mile says many of her customers prefer the idea of eating outdoors. “A lot of people want to sit outside. They think it’s healthier,\" she said. \"They’re probably not going to want to sit out when it’s 100, 105, but the evenings, Stockton has nice weather for eating out and it’s a good thing for everybody.” The city has stated that the restaurants are critical to the local economy and promised to get the no-fee permits issued as soon as possible.  8:15 a.m.: Wineries welcome back customers  Even though tasting rooms are still closed, wine lovers can again share a bottle at local wineries.  California wineries have been closed since late March.  The State’s Alcoholic Beverage Control Board has relaxed rules that allow winery customers to buy a bottle to enjoy outside of tasting rooms, as long as they order food to go with it.  Bokisch Vineyards manager Kristine DeBock says the Lodi winery has 100 acres and picnic tables outside that can accommodate 150 people.  The winery opened up last weekend, and she says the word was put out on social media with an instant response.  “Within two minutes our phones and emails were ringing off the hook and blowing up, so it was an absolutely positive experience for us to see that everyone missed us as much as we missed them,” said DeBock.  Not all wineries will be opening up due to size or space restrictions, but many feel it’s a step in the right direction.  7:50 a.m.: Retail workers describe violent confrontations during COVID-19  Retail workers across the country are facing insults, threats and even attacks from customers upset over being told they had to comply with coronavirus restrictions in stores.  One retail store manager in Modesto has decided to fight back with a Facebook page called \"Retail Life During COVID-19.\"  After posting a photo of her bruised and bloody face that she said she suffered after being punched by an angry shopper, Samantha Clarke quickly accumulated tens of thousands of followers. Some told her their stories of similar harassment.  Friday, June 5  5:24 p.m.: California to allow bars, gyms to reopen next week with restrictions  California plans to allow bars and gyms to reopen next week — with restrictions like not allowing customers to pull up a stool at a bar or possibly shower after breaking a sweat during a workout. The Department of Public Health also issued new guidelines for those businesses as well as schools, day camps, casinos and the film and entertainment industry on Friday. As with previous businesses that have reopened under the state’s “phase two” modifications, there will be a variety of restrictions for the new fleet of reopenings. Teachers at schools will be required to wear face shields, and students will be provided face coverings. Counties that have met certain benchmarks will be allowed to start reopening these businesses on Friday, June 12.  8:00 a.m.: Second California prison employee dies after COVID-19 diagnosis  Another California state prison employee died Wednesday after testing positive for coronavirus.  California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation spokeswoman Dana Simas said the employee worked in plant operations at Ironwood State Prison in eastern Riverside County.  The department did not release any more information, citing the family’s privacy.  According to the AP, nearly 400 Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation employees have tested positive, but nearly half of those people have returned to work.  7:30 a.m.: Nevada church says coronavirus order violates religious freedom  Nevada\\'s lawyers are defending Gov. Steve Sisolak’s 50-person cap on religious gatherings in a legal battle with leaders of a church who say it violates their constitutional right to exercise their beliefs.  The governor’s order was aimed at curbing the spread of coronavirus.  Nevada Attorney General Aaron Ford is urging a federal judge in Reno to deny an order sought by leaders of Calvary Chapel Dayton Valley to invalidate the state’s COVID-19 restrictions so up to 90 people can attend services at a time. The church, located outside of Carson City, has a regular capacity of 200 people.  Church leaders say the hard cap violates their religious freedom, treating them differently than many businesses who have been allowed to reopen at 50% capacity.  A hearing is set for Tuesday on their request for a temporary injunction suspending the cap after a judge denied their bid last week for an emergency order.  According to CDC guidelines, faith-based gatherings present a risk for COVID-19. The CDC has offered \"suggestions for faith communities to consider and accept, reject, or modify, consistent with their own faith traditions, in the course of preparing to reconvene for in-person gatherings while still working to prevent the spread of COVID-19.\"  Thursday, June 4  4:11 p.m.: Nevada casinos reopen with safety precautions  Taxes on gambling revenue provide nearly one-fifth of Nevada’s budget. So when Gov. Steve Sisolak ordered casinos to close in March, it was unprecedented.  Resorts are now back open for the first time since stay-at-home orders went into effect, under Phase Two of Sisolak’s reopening plan. But in order to welcome visitors back, they had to adopt new safety measures.  Those include limiting the number of guests to half capacity, installing plexiglass shields between players and dealers and restricting the number of slot machines to encourage physical distancing.  Workers are also required to wear masks, although customers don’t have to.  8:05 a.m.: New rules for in-person voting during pandemic  Gov. Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Wednesday aimed at helping Californians vote in a safe, and accessible manner during the November election, while curbing the spread of COVID-19.  “We are committed to protecting the hard-fought right for Californians to make their voices heard this November, even in the face of a pandemic,” said Newsom said in a statement.  In addition to making sure there are enough in-person voting opportunities that maintain physical distancing, the executive order rules include:  Counties that are unable to comply with current law need to provide three days of early voting starting the Saturday before election day  Ballot drop-box locations need to be available between October 6 and November 3  Counties are allowed to consolidate voting locations, with at least one voting location per 10,000 registered voters  The executive order comes one month after Newsom decided to send every registered voter a mail-in ballot for the November election.  7:43 a.m.: Survey: Many Californians believe coronavirus crisis will worsen  A slight majority of Californians believe the worst is yet to come for the coronavirus pandemic, according to a new survey from the Public Policy Institute of California.  PPIC President Marc Baldassare says 69% of African Americans say the worst is coming compared to 41% of whites.  “There are strong racial disparities and income differences in California that have placed Californians, especially African Americans, in a very vulnerable situation during this particular health and economic crisis,” said Baldassare.  The economic impacts of the pandemic are far-reaching — one in three California adults has reported a job loss due to the virus, and just over half of those surveyed say someone in their household has lost income or had work hours reduced.  Overall, Californians approve of Gov. Gavin Newsom’s handling of the crisis — he has a 65% approval rating, a 12% jump from February. But his revised budget, which proposes steep cuts to education and other public services, is getting mixed reviews.  Wednesday June 3  5:20 p.m.: Yosemite will open to some backpackers, climbers Yosemite will reopen to wilderness backpackers and hikers climbing Half Dome this Friday. The national park will be offering more activities in the coming days. They are working with the state and the surrounding counties of Tuolumne, Mariposa, Mono, and Madera to reopen the park fully. Park Ranger Scott Gediman said that reopening will see much smaller crowds, though. “By managing the visitation and trying to keep it at 50% of the levels, we feel that this is a good balance,” he said. Other reasons include more social distancing, a limited staff to accommodate visitors, and fewer campgrounds available. He reminded backpackers and Half Dome hikers coming this weekend to bring all their food, water, and a full tank of gas because no stores will be open.  8:55 a.m. California braces for second coronavirus wave As the economy reopens in California and around the country, health experts have warned of a potential second wave of the coronavirus. According to data from Johns Hopkins University, California is one of about 20 states where new cases are increasing over the past five days. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis, the number of weekly cases in California exceeded 17,000 last week for the first time during the pandemic. 7:50 a.m. USC will reopen for in-person classes in August The University of Southern California has announced plans to offer in-person classes for the Fall 2020 semester. University president Carol Folt informed the campus community in an online letter Tuesday. USC plans on starting classes on August 17 and ending final exams by Thanksgiving. “By ending the semester before Thanksgiving, we are aiming to minimize the spread of the virus, particularly as the flu season commences,” Folt said in the letter. The campus will also offer online sessions for every in-person class in order to offer more flexibility for students, faculty and staff. Folt added: “Please understand that these plans remain contingent on several factors, including the continued spread of COVID-19, and the health orders from state and local authorities. So, things could change, but we are excited to move forward and to have you back.” 7:30 a.m. Nevada casino workers weigh health risks of reopening Casinos in Nevada are reopening Thursday, after being shuttered for more than two months. Workers are now weighing the health risks of returning to work in one of the country\\'s entertainment and hospitality capitals. Labor leaders such as Geoconda Argüello-Kline want more transparency from Nevada resorts. Argüello-Kline is the secretary-treasurer of the Culinary Workers Union Local 226 and she says their 60,000 members want to see hotels and casinos make their full COVID-19 mitigation plans available to the public, rather than the partial plans that have been released so far. Her union is also calling for hotels and casinos to regularly test 100% of their employees.

On its website, Vitalant says it will use an FDA-authorized antibody test on each donation.  \"While a positive antibody test does not mean that someone is immune to COVID-19, it does mean that they may be eligible to donate convalescent plasma in the future and help people with the disease,\" Vitalant chief of marketing Cliff Numark told KQED News.  The nonprofit group serves patients throughout the state. It says it has a critical need for blood donations.  7:50 a.m.: LA County Officials: First pregnant woman death from coronavirus  Los Angeles County officials reported an additional 22 coronavirus-linked deaths Monday, including a pregnant woman who had tested positive for the virus and had underlying health issues.  According to the LA Times, this is the first of its kind in the county related to COVID-19.  Health officials say at least 228 pregnant women in L.A.

Monday, June 1  8:15 a.m. Census field operation delays in Los Angele County Safety concerns over COVID-19 delayed the start of census takers’ visits to homes in Los Angeles County Monday. LAist.com reports Orange County is resuming census visits today and Ventura and San Bernardino counties reopened their offices last week to begin the so-called process of “Update Leave.” This means census workers can drop off questionnaires at homes in remote areas. According to the LA Census office, it is not safe to send census takers into LA communities and the county’s health department has not signed off on this work. 7:50 a.m. Health risks as George Floyd protests continue Several protesters are weighing the risks of demonstrating in public as California and communities around the nation struggle with containing COVID-19 cases. Mass demonstrations over the police killing of George Floyd extended from Sacramento down to San Diego this weekend. The state’s Department of Public Health shared guidelines for how to protest safely during the pandemic. The LA Times reports that even six feet of distance between protesters may not be enough to prevent virus transmission among protesters.  “If you have breakdowns in social distancing and don’t have masks on, then you’re deeply in trouble,” said UC San Francisco epidemiologist Dr. George Rutherford.  Friday, May 29  1:35 p.m.: Sacramento County closes two parks for Saturday due to large, unpermitted events    The Sacramento County Regional Parks Department is closing Discovery Park and Tiscornia Beach, two popular riverfront spots, for one day on Saturday, May 30.  We’ve become aware of three separate, large & unpermitted events planned for Discovery Park/Tiscornia Beach on 5/30, so in an effort to protect public safety & health, these areas will be CLOSED on 5/30. The park will re-open on 5/31. The multi-use trail will remain open. pic.twitter.com/XV56BR2a1N — SacRegionalParks (@SacRegionalPark) May 29, 2020  The department decided to close the parks after learning of three large, unpermitted events planned for those parks that day. The parks will reopen on May 31, and the multi-use trail will remain open through the weekend.  All park picnic sites and barbecue areas in the county remain closed due to COVID-19, and individuals are required to follow social distancing requirements while visiting parks.  7:30 a.m.: Colusa County stops enforcing shelter-in-place order Colusa County supervisors voted to stop enforcing any COVID-19 guidance or orders, including Gov. Gavin Newsom’s statewide shelter-in-place order, during a special meeting Thursday. It was an unanimous vote. “The Colusa County Board of Supervisors support all citizens, businesses, schools, churches, and organizations in exercising their constitutional rights,” said Supervisor Gary Evans in a press release. This move allows the reopening of all businesses in Colusa County. 7:05 a.m.: Conservation workers rescue seedlings for Plumas National Forest The pandemic has made it harder for forestry workers to plant seedlings in the Plumas National Forest, which was damaged by last year\\'s Walker Fire. They were working with Placerville Nursery, who had to stop delivering seedlings because of the shutdown. So conservation workers made a middle-of-the-night run, rescuing about 25,000 seedlings, and made to take the 3-hour drive from Placerville to the Plumas National Forest. Feather River Resource Conservation District Manager Brad Graevs says the move was necessary because the planting couldn\\'t wait as the soil gets too dry by late May.  Thurday, May 28  3:51 p.m.: Yolo County ends local shelter-in-place order, but state order still applies Yolo County has ended its local shelter-in-place order, while maintaining an order for residents to wear face coverings in public and emphasizing personal responsibility. California’s statewide stay-at-home order is still in effect, and still applies to Yolo County residents. Businesses that aren’t approved by state and local health officers are still prohibited from opening, and residents are still encouraged to practice proper social distancing and hygiene. The new order also allows for residents to resume activities now permitted under phase 2 of the statewide reopening. You can track which activities have been approved by Yolo County’s health officer here.  1:40 p.m.: California’s new unemployment claims drop to 212,000, lowest weekly total in two months California’s employment picture is still bleak even as some businesses reopen following COVID-19 shutdowns. But one new statistic offers a bit of hope: The state recorded 212,300 first-time jobless claims last week, the lowest level in two months, according to a U.S. Labor Department report released Thursday. The figure represents workers who have applied for unemployment benefits due to lost jobs or hours. That number is down from last week’s 244,000 applications and is the lowest weekly total since the week ending March 21, when 186,000 Californians filed first-time unemployment claims at the beginning of the statewide closures. Last week, the state’s Employment Development Department announced it had processed 5.1 million unemployment claims since March 12. It also reported that California’s jobless rate nearly tripled in April to a record high 15.5 percent as employers eliminated 2.3 million jobs statewide. On Wednesday, EDD said it will hire approximately 1,800 new staff to speed up the processing and delivery of unemployment benefits. The state agency has struggled to handle the huge volume of claims and many have complained about long waits to reach customer service representatives by phone. CapRadio is answering questions here about California’s unemployment benefits during the COVID-19 crisis. 9:25 a.m.: Davis extends eviction protection for renters to June Landlords could not evict commercial and residential tenants in Davis if they couldn\\'t pay rent in April and May, and now they won\\'t be able to in June, either. The city is the first in the Sacramento area to extend its local emergency and allow renter relief due to the COVID-19 crisis into next month. Tenants have to provide a written notice to their landlord no more than 10 days after the rent is due and show proof they\\'ve been impacted financially by the pandemic. Tenants will have to pay back the rent eventually. The city is giving them six months after the local emergency expires.  7:30 a.m.: New mandatory testing rules at California nursing homes  In a move to slow COVID-19 cases, the state department of public health issued new rules for testing health care professionals and residents at nursing homes.  According to the LA Times, state health officials sent a letter to all skilled nursing facilities in California instructing them to test all residents and staff at least once.  “Skilled nursing facilities (SNFs) have been severely impacted by COVID-19, with outbreaks causing high morbidity and mortality,” said the department’s deputy director Heidi Steinecker in the letter. “The vulnerable nature of the SNF population combined with the inherent risks of congregate living in a healthcare setting requires aggressive efforts to limit COVID-19 exposure and to prevent the spread of COVID-19 within SNFs.”  If a nursing home shows no cases, the new rules require it to continue testing 25% of residents and healthcare workers on a weekly basis. The facility must also ensure that all staff members are tested once per month.  California is updating a list of skilled nursing facilities with confirmed COVID-19 cases here.  6:55 a.m.: Nevada casinos welcome back gamblers  Steep room discounts and free airline tickets are just some of the ways Nevada casinos are trying to bring back customers after the state set a date for reopening on June 4.  The AP reports promotions began Wednesday after Gov. Steve Sisolak lifted the casino shut-down order he imposed in mid-March to prevent the spread of coronavirus.  “I want to welcome you back to Las Vegas and in doing so, we’re buying a thousand flights, from various cities around the country on a number of airlines,” said Derek Stevens, owner of the D Las Vegas, Golden Gate Hotel & Casino and Circa Sports, in a video on the resort’s website. “It’s on us.”  In Lake Tahoe, the Hard Rock Hotel & Casino at Lake Tahoe offered free one-night stays to essential workers and one-night room rates of $20.20, as part of a “Reboot Your Year” promotion.  The Nevada Gaming Control Board issued new health and safety rules for resorts who are reopening, including:  Having face coverings available for patrons and guests.  Encouraging patrons and guests to wear face coverings while in public places.  Requiring hotel guests to complete a symptom self-assessment upon check-in.  Wednesday, May 27  6:13 p.m.: State health workers protest possible budget cuts California is facing a steep budget shortfall, and Gov. Gavin Newsom says he may have to cut programs to make ends meet. But some people who work for those programs are pushing back. Service providers such as Andrea Noble, who helps out elderly and disabled Californians for the state’s In-Home Supportive Services program, are demanding the state look for other solutions. IHSS is facing cuts of nearly $300 million. Two-thirds of that would come from a reduction in service hours. “I don’t think it’s fair for the governor or the legislature to cut IHSS workers,” Noble said at a union-organized car protest outside the state capitol Wednesday. “We’re always the ones getting cut.” But with such a big deficit hole, there are workers and advocates like Noble across the state protesting similar cuts to their programs. State workers could see a 10% pay cut. Education and public safety could get slashed, too, which would likely result in teacher and first responder layoffs as local governments struggle with their own budget deficits. Newsom is hoping to prevent the deepest cuts with federal aid — but that may not come through. Still, some lawmakers, like Assemblyman Rob Bonta, D-Alameda, say there may be a way to save some of these programs from the deepest cuts — by raising some taxes. “There’s a whole set of possibilities,” Bonta said, including temporary tax hikes for corporations and the wealthiest Californians. “I’m not saying they all will work, but maybe some could,” he said. Bonta said he and several of his Democratic colleagues are hesitant to cut health and social services, especially during a pandemic. “We can’t just say they’re heroes, we need to show that they’re heroes,” he said of frontline service providers. “They need us to invest in them, not cut from them.\"  5:50 p.m.: 100,000 lives taken by COVID-19 nationwide As of Wednesday afternoon, COVID-19 has taken 100,000 lives nationwide, accounting for nearly one-third of all the known lives lost worldwide to the pandemic. People have died from the disease in all 50 states and most U.S. territories. Public health experts say the coronavirus has exposed the vulnerability of a wide range of Americans and the shortcomings of a U.S. health care system faced with a deadly pandemic. \"What is different about this is, it is affecting all of us in a variety of ways, even if some of us are able to social distance in more effective ways than others,\" sociology professor Kathleen Cagney, who directs the University of Chicago\\'s Population Research Center, told NPR \"But we all feel at risk.\"  4:49 pm.: California employment department looks to hire 1,800 workers The California Employment Development Department is conducting a mass-hiring to deal with a huge backlog of claims that has led to sharp criticism of the department. The EDD says it\\'s looking to hire 1,800 temporary workers over the next several weeks to speed up the delivery of benefits. The agency says the new hires will be trained in call center operations, processing claims, and analyzing documents from filers and employers to help determine wage benefits. EDD has received increased federal funding to support the staffing increase it says is necessary to deal with historic demand. As of the middle of the month, EDD had processed over 5 million claims for unemployment and paid more than $16 billion in benefits to workers who\\'ve filed since the pandemic began. Find answers to questions about unemployment in California here.  3 p.m.: Half of Americans ready to get COVID-19 vaccine, others unsure Only about half of Americans say they would get a COVID-19 vaccine if the scientists working furiously to create one succeed. Another 31% simply aren\\'t sure, while 20% say they\\'d refuse. That\\'s according to a survey from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Among Americans who say they wouldn’t get vaccinated, 7 in 10 worry about safety. Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, told the AP that while scientists are working quickly, all testing and safety protocols will be followed before releasing any vaccine.  8:45 a.m. Oakland A’s minor leaguers will no longer be paid, scouts to be furloughed  As part of cost-cutting moves in response to COVID-19, the Oakland Athletics will place their scouts and front office employees on furlough and suspend pay for minor leaguers.  SFGate reports the team will also cut the salaries of other executives.  “COVID-19 has brought a tragic loss of life and sickness to so many in our community, and it has impacted us all in ways we could have never imagined,” said A\\'s owner John Fisher in a letter to fans and staff. “Our organization, like so many others across the country, has had to make tough and painful decisions.”  According to the Mercury News, the team has not paid its rent on the Oakland Coliseum because of the pandemic.  7:50 a.m. Los Angeles County reopens in-person dining, houses of worships  A revised order released Tuesday night from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health allows the reopening of several activities, from religious services to in-store shopping at so-called low-risk stores.  Under the order, indoor malls and shopping centers can open up to 50% capacity and faith-based organizations can hold services with a limit of 25% of the buildings capacity.  The changes follow Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order that allows hair salons and barbershops to open in several counties throughout the state, with restrictions.  Tuesday, May 26  2:27 p.m.: Summer heat could slow or change coronavirus spread Scientists say the hot weather could help stop the spread of COVID-19. On Insight with Beth Ruyak Tuesday, UC Davis Children’s Hospital Pediatric Infectious Diseases Chief Dr. Dean Blumberg said there are several factors to consider. One is that people go outside when it heats up. \"If people are outdoors more in the summer, which they may not be during this extreme heat, that\\'s a great way to interrupt transmission of virus because most of the transmission occurs indoors and that\\'s why there\\'s more transmission during the winter,\" Blumberg said. The other factors are that the virus doesn\\'t survive as well in heat and high humidity. But Blumberg warns that since this is a novel virus and the vast majority of the population is still susceptible to it, we could have continuing transmission in the summer as we did in 2009 with a strain of the swine flu.  12:31 p.m.: Sacramento looking to allocate nearly $3 million for city youth services  The city of Sacramento will be voting on how to allocate part of its $89.6 million in federal stimulus funds Tuesday.  Councilmember Jay Schenirer is proposing that $2 million of the stimulus be spent on summer learning for the city’s youth. An additional $250,000 is being proposed to be spent on youth workforce training, and another $250,000 could be put towards youth mental health services.  “There’s an opportunity to really help those and bridge the gap that’s been caused by COVID-19 and also thinking about what we need in our communities,” Schenirer said. “Lots of groups are asking for dollars, lots of groups have gotten hurt by this, but I believe youth has to be a priority for us as we move forward.”  The city is also voting on a plan to use $550,000 of federal stimulus money to provide free internet access for students in need.  Officials said they did not want summer programs to just be distance learning programs, though they acknowledged they would be taking the safety of in-person gatherings into account. Some suggestions included summer classes limited to 10 students, in addition to virtual mental health check-ins and online physical education and arts classes.  “We’re not calling this summer school, we’re calling it summer enrichment. We have an opportunity to do social emotional learning, we have an opportunity to do mental health services,” Schenirer said. “I think there’s a lot we can do for these young people to keep them interested.”  More details of the city’s youth plan can be found here and here.  7:43 a.m. Pandemic boosts bicycle sales  Cooped-up Americans are snapping up new bicycles or dusting off old bikes to stay fit, keep their sanity or have a safe alternative to public transportation.  The AP reports that the coronavirus pandemic is proving to be a boon for bike shops, which have seen a surge in sales.  In California and around the nation, bicycles are selling out and officials are trying to take advantage of the growing trend by expanding bike lanes or widening existing ones to make space for commuters on two wheels.  7:15 a.m. Holiday crowds prompt officials to close California trail  The Los Angeles County Parks and Recreation shutdown Eaton Canyon Trail this weekend due to a high volume of hikers who were not wearing face masks or observing social distancing guidelines.  “While we understand that trails are a beloved form of recreation that offers much-needed opportunities for exercise, respite, getting fresh air, and connecting with nature, the public did not follow the guidelines required, and it put themselves and staff at risk,” LA County Parks officials said on their website.  LA County Park officials say many visitors ignored instructions issued by park monitors and many visitors also entered the park and trail through unauthorized or temporarily closed trail access points. They say they had no choice but to close the trailhead and trail because of this behavior.  Eaton Canyon Trail will stay closed through Sunday.  Monday, May 25  4:55 p.m.: Retail stores now allowed to open statewide The state of California says all counties now have the discretion to allow stores and churches to allow people inside their doors, pending county approval. Churches are restricted to 25% occupancy with a 100-person maximum. Previous guidelines of face coverings and six feet of social distancing are still in place for churches and retail stores. Ross Rojek and his wife Heidi own Capital Books on K Street in Sacramento. He says they and their customers have been waiting for this day. “We’ve met a lot of new people. We’ve got a lot of new customers and now they’re starting to come into the store for the first time,\" Rojek said. \"For a lot of them they’re excited about that because they’ve only just talked to us on the phone, and emailed us and seen pictures online and now finally they get to come in and see the store and shop the shelves.” Rojek says Capital Books actually benefited from the COVID-19 shutdown because of the store’s ability to fill orders quickly, while large online outfits struggled. The bookstore is also now carrying more puzzles, educational materials and children’s books. The Downtown Sacramento Partnership says more than half of downtown businesses have reopened as of last week. Nail salons and barbershops are still not allowed to open.  1:46 pm.: As people drive less, car thefts increase The coronavirus hasn\\'t been kind to car owners. With more people than ever staying home to lessen the spread of COVID-19, their sedans, pickup trucks and SUVs are parked unattended on the streets. That makes them easy targets for thieves. Despite silent streets and nearly nonexistent traffic, vehicle larcenies shot up 63% in New York and nearly 17% in Los Angeles since the year started, compared with the same period last year. Many law enforcement agencies around the U.S. are reporting an increase in stolen cars and vehicle burglaries, even as violent crime has dropped dramatically nationwide in the coronavirus pandemic. — The Associated Press  7:04 a.m.: Butte County sees rise in confirmed cases Butte County confirmed 12 new COVID-19 cases in the past week, mostly in the Oroville area, health officials announced Friday. In a press release, Butte County Public Health says the jump is in part due to more testing, but also indicates \"increased community spread in the Oroville area.\" Five people were hospitalized with COVID-19 related illnesses last week. Only one of the new cases is linked to a Mother\\'s Day church service where 180 people were potentially exposed to the virus. Overall, 34 people have tested positive for COVID-19 in Butte County since March, or 15 cases per 100,000 people. No COVID-19 related deaths have been reported in the county. Health officials encouraged residents to continue following reopening guidelines, including wearing masks in public places, limiting travel, avoiding gatherings, and keeping six-feet away from others.  6:14 a.m.: Court upholds state ban on in-person church services An appeals court has upheld California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s ban on in-person church services amid the coronavirus pandemic. The split ruling found that government’s emergency powers override what in normal times would be fundamental constitutional rights. The 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that South Bay United Pentecostal Church in San Diego cannot reopen immediately, the Los Angeles Times reported. The judges in the majority wrote that the state can use unusual powers as it deals with a “contagious and often fatal disease.” The decision is likely to further anger opponents who claim that California’s rules violate religious freedoms. — The Associated Press  Saturday, May 23  4:15 p.m.: Protesters rally at Capitol despite easing of stay-at-home restrictions  Hundreds of protesters rallied outside the state Capitol on Saturday to protest against California\\'s stay-at-home orders even as residents entered the Memorial Day weekend with newly expanded options for going to the beach, barbecuing and shopping.  Restrictions have been eased across much of the state, with some 45 of 58 counties receiving permission over the past two weeks to reopen most stores and many public spaces by meeting state standards for controlling the coronavirus.  Expected high temperatures this weekend are expected to lure people to beaches, hiking trails and bike paths. But authorities are warning visitors to practice social distancing and other other anti-virus measures, noting that the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths continues to rise — just more slowly.  — The Associated Press  Friday, May 22  5:09 p.m.: Nevada has nation\\'s highest unemployment rate More than a quarter of Nevadans are out of work. That’s according to the Nevada Department of Employment, Training and Rehabilitation, which released its April 2020 economic report today. It\\'s the first one showing the full impact of coronavirus-related closures. Dave Schmidt is chief economist for the department. He says Nevada’s unemployment rate was over 28%, more than double the previous record. Nevada has the highest unemployment rate in the nation followed by Michigan, which had a rate of 22.7%. Nevada now also has the highest unemployment rate of any state, of any month, dating back to 1976. Casinos represent a large percent of Nevada’s revenues and labor market. They remain closed, even though the state has begun the first phase of its reopening plan.  4:21 p.m.: California lawmakers criticize state handling of unemployment claims California lawmakers say the state isn’t paying unemployment benefits fast enough. Many say their offices are overwhelmed by constituents calling for help because they’re unable to get into the system or file a claim. EDD has extended its phone hours, and its director told lawmakers she’s bringing on 600 more employees to help meet demand. But at a legislative hearing Thursday, lawmakers including San Francisco Democrat David Chiu said it’s still not enough. “I get that there is an unprecedented workload, but I believe that government can do better and it has to do better during this time,” Chiu said. California has paid more than $12 billion in unemployment benefits since mid-March. The governor’s office is projecting a peak unemployment rate of nearly 25 percent this year. The state lost a record 2.3 million jobs in April, according to figures released Friday, and its unemployment rate nearly tripled to 15.5%. “The unprecedented job losses are like nothing before seen in California history in a current data series that dates back to 1976, and are a direct result of the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic,” EDD said in the jobs report.  7:57 a.m. Big Bear Lake will not enforce stay-at-home order Big Bear Lake city council members voted to allow businesses and residents to do what they want to do in regard to California’s stay-at-home order. Big Bear Grizzly reports the council approved this statement during a special meeting Thursday: “City will not enforce governor’s orders, encourages all businesses and residents to maintain 6 feet of separation, wear face coverings and practice good hygiene as outlined in city plan.” City manager Frank Rush says this is because of the low number of cases in the area and the businesses who are suffering economic and social harm due to the stay-at-home-order. 7:34 a.m.: Report: 4 million SoCal jobs at risk due to coronavirus New reports show high unemployment rates are expected to last through 2021 in Southern California. The LA Times reviewed a new study by McKinsey & Co. who examined data from Los Angeles, Orange and San Diego counties. The consulting firm identified 4 million jobs are vulnerable across the region, which covers workers who have lost their jobs as well as those at risk of being placed on unpaid leave or having wages cut due to coronavirus.  Thursday, May 21  7:08 p.m.: San Joaquin County gets approval to open restaurants, malls San Joaquin, Fresno and Alpine are the latest counties to receive state approval to reopen malls and restaurants under what‘s known as “expanded Stage 2.” It means some businesses can open beyond what’s allowed statewide, as long as specific sanitation and social distancing measures are implemented. Counties have to meet certain testing and epidemiological benchmarks in order to be granted the status. Gov. Gavin Newsom loosened the criteria earlier this week, opening the doors for more counties to reopen additional businesses. So far, more than 40 counties with a combined population of 13.2 million have been approved.  5:38 p.m.: Imperial County hospitals resume taking COVID-19 patients after surge prompted diversions A sparsely populated farming region of California is struggling with a spike in COVID-19 cases. The surge in Imperial County, east of San Diego, prompted the county’s two hospitals to divert COVID-19 patients elsewhere on Tuesday, according to KPBS. They’ve since resumed accepting patients. Adolphe Edward, CEO of the El Centro Regional Medical Center, said in a Facebook video Wednesday that the hospital had 53 COVID-19 patients. That was down from 65 on Tuesday ― a rise that hospital officials attributed to U.S. citizens living in Mexico coming to the county for treatment. The county has fewer than 300 hospital beds to serve its 181,000 residents. It also has the highest hospitalization rate for coronavirus patients in the state. As of Thursday, 985 residents have tested positive and 19 have died. The seven-day average of newly reported cases was 48 a day.  4:04 p.m.: Nearly 250,000 Californians filed first-time unemployment claims last week In a sign of continuing economic pain, 246,000 more Californians filed first-time jobless claims last week, up 33,000 from the week before, the U.S. Department of Labor reported on Thursday morning. The new figures suggest California’s total jobless claims since the COVID-19 induced shutdowns started in mid-March will soon top 5 million. The state’s Employment Development Department said a week ago it had processed 4.7 million unemployment claims since March 12. In a news release Thursday afternoon, the agency announced the total had, indeed, topped that figure and reached 5.1 million claims. The federal report also shows a continued surge in Californians applying for the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program, including 112,000 new claims last week. More than 136,000 applied the week before. The PUA provides a minimum “base benefit” of $167 per week for people in the non-traditional part of the workforce who have lost jobs due to COVID-19, including part-time workers, independent contractors, the self-employed and others who traditionally do not qualify for unemployment help. On top of their base benefit, affected workers are eligible for $600 per week in unemployment assistance through the end of July. The PUA is a federal program approved as part of the CARES Act in March. It is administered by EDD, though it did not start accepting applications until late last month. Also on Thursday, state lawmakers questioned EDD Director Sharon Hilliard during an Assembly Budget Subcommittee hearing. The state agency has been overwhelmed with unemployment claims and phone calls from those seeking information about their benefits. Several lawmakers urged Hilliard to ensure the agency’s staff provide answers more quickly. The director said EDD was getting ready to hire 1,800 more employees over the next two weeks to work on insurance claims and answer calls.  1:27 p.m.: Sacramento looking to provide free internet to low-income households Sacramento Mayor Darrell Steinberg announced Thursday that about 10,000 low-income households in the city may soon be getting free internet service. \"This is part of our drive to build a modern, inclusive economy,\" Steinberg said. It\\'s about school kids yes, but it\\'s about entire families.\" City School Board Member Mai Vang says it\\'s an investment in building Sacramento\\'s digital infrastructure. \"Throughout Sacramento, the lack of access [to the] internet isn\\'t something new, right?\" Vang said. \"It has plagued our low-income families long before the pandemic and if we don\\'t have a long term strategy, eventually it\\'s going to be an issue.\" The City Council will vote next week on a plan to use more than $500,000 of federal stimulus money — provided by the CARES Act — to partner with Comcast. People will be able to get 60 days of free internet service and then pay only $10 a month. Vice Mayor Angelique Ashby says the program is intended for low-income people. \"We will help you pay for six months after your first two free months with Comcast,\" Ashby said. \"This should get 10,000 people in the city of Sacramento connected through the end of 2020.\" After that, Steinberg says it depends on the city\\'s \"fiscal situation\" as to whether the program will continue. The federal stimulus money will also be used to pay for a-thousand low-cost computers. The full city council is expected to approve the plan next Tuesday.  8:04 a.m. Sacramento and San Diego counties move to expanded Stage 2  The California Department of Public Health approved requests from San Diego and Sacramento counties to move into the so-called “expanded\" Stage 2 of the state’s reopening plan.  They join the expanding list of counties who have filed for permission to allow specific businesses to reopen with physical distancing and sanitation measures.  According to the department, counties who have made it this stage have a plan in place to help meet the state’s goal for reopening in a way that minimizes risk for COVID-19, including:  Limiting non-essential movement and mixing of populations  Delaying the opening of environments in which there is prolonged and close contact as part of the way business must operate  The approval allows counties to open up businesses such as dine-in restaurants, retails stores and malls, and schools with modifications.  7:45 a.m. California educators expect ‘hybrid classrooms’ in fall  State Schools Superintendent Tony Thurmond said he expects school for the state’s 6 million students to resume as usual in late August or September with a hybrid format of in-person and distance learning.  According to the Associated Press, Thurmond says students, teachers and staff will most likely have to wear masks.  University of California President Janet Napolitano gave a similar forecast Wednesday for how the system’s 10 campuses may look come fall. She told UC Regents Wednesday that most campuses are still making decisions on their fall scenarios, which may be finalized in next month.  Wednesday, May 20  7:06 p.m.: Yolo County gets state approval to open restaurants, malls California has now approved 37 counties to reopen restaurants and malls with modifications. Yolo, Stanislaus, Kern, Ventura and several other counties were given the green light to move into what the California Department of Public Health is calling “expanded Stage 2” on Wednesday. It means these additional businesses can resume operations with sanitation and physical distancing measures: Retail stores including shopping malls and swap meets  Dine-in restaurants (other amenities, like bars or gaming areas, are not permitted)  Schools with modifications Six million Californians live within counties that have been approved for additional reopenings. On Tuesday, Sacramento County announced it had been approved, but it is not yet listed on the state’s website. No county with a population of more than 1 million has been approved yet.  6:20 p.m.: UOP website debunks COVID-19 myths You can find a lot of information — and misinformation — about COVID-19 on the internet. Pharmacy students at University of the Pacific are setting the record straight by busting the myths online. Assistant Professor Yvonne Mai at the UOP School of Pharmacy, along with nine students, are debunking 24 common myths on their website. Myths include: “I’m young and healthy, so I’m immune to the virus,” “Drinking hydrogen peroxide will kill COVID-19,” or “Pets can spread coronavirus.”    To find out the answers, you can visit the website here.  1:06 p.m.: Sacramento health director worried about Memorial Day weekend as county loosens restrictions As Sacramento County prepares to loosen some COVID-19 restrictions this week, county Health Services Director Dr. Peter Beilenson is worried about what could happen over Memorial Day weekend. In an interview on Insight with Beth Ruyak, Beilenson expressed his concerns about “people potentially going hog wild on a beautiful Memorial Day weekend and tying up 35 rafts going down the American River.” The county has plans this week to allow shopping malls, dine-in restaurants and more to open up. But Beilenson made clear that doesn\\'t mean things can go back to the way they were before the shutdown. Rafting will not be allowed under the county’s updated guidelines, but beaches will be open over the three-day weekend as long as people practice proper social distancing. \"We do not want a bunch of unrelated people congregating on a bunch of rafts piling up on the American River because that\\'s how you end up with 30 cases and boom you\\'re off to the races in terms of starting up an epidemic again,\" he said.  8:45 a.m.: Tulare County defies state health orders with reopening  Tulare County health officials reported an increase of 101 COVID-19 cases and four more deaths Tuesday, as county supervisors voted to reopen businesses and churches \"effective immediately\" in defiance of the state\\'s public health orders.  Visalia Times Delta reports Tuesday’s vote covers dine-in restaurants, churches, barbershops, movie theaters and shopping malls.  On Monday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said nursing home outbreaks would prevent Tulare County from moving to the next phase of reopening.  7:45 a.m.: California blood banks need plasma donations from COVID-19 survivors  California blood banks are asking COVID-19 survivors to donate plasma.  They’re working with hospitals to get plasma to current coronavirus patients. There’s some evidence showing the antibodies in the plasma could help COVID-19 patients recover faster. This type of plasma does not have FDA approval yet, but it’s considered an investigational product. This is one of many coronavirus therapies that scientists are looking into.  Blood service providers like Vitalant say demand for blood is up 25% now that hospitals are performing regular surgeries again.  Tuesday, May 19  5:40 p.m.: San Diego County asks to reopen sooner California\\'s second-largest county wants to reopen faster than the current rate. San Diego County supervisors have voted to ask the state to allow it to be a test case for whether more rapid reopening can safely occur. The plan approved Tuesday would let it jump ahead in the governor\\'s four-stage plan for counties and try opening everything from condo swimming pools to outdoor religious services with restrictions. The vote came a day after the governor made it easier for the state\\'s 58 counties to reopen more businesses, saying COVID-19 hospitalizations statewide have declined. 5:18 p.m.: School districts tell governor they need more funding to start school year Sacramento and five other California school districts say the governor\\'s proposed budget cuts will delay the reopening of schools. Los Angeles Unified officials joined the other districts Monday in a letter to legislators, saying they need more money to safely reopen schools. The other districts are San Francisco, Oakland, San Diego and Long Beach. Gov. Gavin Newsom has proposed $14 billion in budget cuts because of the coronavirus. The superintendents said the idea of reopening schools in a pandemic with a decreased budget is not realistic.  3 p.m.: State approves Sacramento County request to speed up reopening Sacramento County has received approval from the state to move into its expanded Stage 2 reopening, county health officials announced Tuesday. The approval allows the county to reopen dine-in restaurants, malls and schools with modifications, which they expect to do by Friday. More than 20 counties have been approved since the state announced new guidelines on May 7, though Sacramento was only approved after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced relaxed criteria for counties Monday. The approval comes as the county announced it would likely extend its own stay-at-home order when it expires Friday.  7:47 a.m.: California tribal casinos start reopening  Temperature checks greeted visitors who lined-up for Monday’s reopening of Viejas Casino & Resort, one of the largest tribal casinos in California. In addition to social distancing rules, visitors had to wear face masks at the casino near San Diego.  The AP reports Win-River Resort & Casino in Redding reopened last week. It was the first tribal casino to reopen in the state after the coronavirus outbreak.  Tribes are sovereign authorities and not subject to state and local restrictions on operations during the pandemic.  6:50 a.m.: Fewer people seeking help at community health centers  Community health centers say they’re seeing a drop-off in patients because many fear being deported or getting infected with coronavirus.  NPR reports public health officials are worried about the communities served by these centers: mostly people with low incomes and immigrants. They say they may not be getting proper health care and testing and they may be unable to quarantine themselves. This could contribute to spreading the coronavirus to the wider population.  Dr. Edgar Chavez is the medical director at Universal Community Health Center in South Los Angeles. He says his patients fear that being tested for the coronavirus will land them on a list to be deported.  \"People aren\\'t eating well. They are not exercising, and they are anxious,\" Chavez said. \"I fear that we are going to be hit with a huge wave of uncontrolled patients with chronic care-related conditions, especially diabetes, hypertension and heart disease.\"  Monday, May 18  5:50 p.m.: The Sacramento Zoo reopening rescinded  The Sacramento Zoo can no longer re-open June 1. The zoo announced earlier today that they were set to re-open with advance safety measures, after receiving initial permission from Sacramento County health officials. The plan was rescinded in the afternoon.  The zoo updated their Facebook page, saying, “We will continue to work with government officials to plan for a safe opening. Thank you for your support and your patience. Please stay tuned.”      Original post: After more than eight weeks closed due to stay-at-home orders, the Sacramento Zoo is set to re-open June 1, but with advanced safety measures.  “Your next zoo visit may be a little different than it was in the past,” park officials wrote in an email. “The biggest change to your visit will be planning.”  The zoo will have physical-distancing guidelines in place, like masks worn by staff and visitors over two years old. Guests will also need to remain six feet away from each other. The zoo will be using a paperless transaction system and paper maps will not be given out.  But the biggest change: There will be a limited number of guests, and all visits will need to be reserved online ahead of time.  The zoo has also announced new arrivals including ostriches, a new female giraffe and a few American alligators.  Tickets go on sale May 22 and the zoo goes live on social media Monday and Wednesdays at 11 a.m.  1:36 p.m.: Truckee mayor says visitors, residents need to wear masks to take ‘personal responsibility’ Truckee Mayor Dave Polivy says that even though there is no mandate for masks in Nevada County, visitors and residents should make wearing them a best practice. “We\\'re far from out of this and there are some precautions that we all need to take, like face coverings and keeping these physical distances between people,” Polivy said in an interview on Insight with Beth Ruyak Monday. This past weekend, he said many people around town were not wearing masks and were gathering in small groups. In response, he says visitors to Nevada County and the town need to take more personal responsibility. “There was definitely a … predominant lack of face coverings along with definitely a lot of gathering and stuff like that going on that both I witnessed myself, but it came through loud and clear in a number of different messages to me,” he said. Without an order businesses will have to make that decision on their own, he says. “If we\\'re going to get back on our feet as a community, and as an economy, there are just going to be some changes we all have to make,” he said. “Businesses, mine included, we\\'re just going to require our customers to cover … their mouths.”  9:45 a.m. Butte County religious service exposed 180 to COVID-19  Butte County Public Health announced an investigation is underway after a person diagnosed with COVID-19 attended an in-person religious service on Mother’s Day with more than 180 people in attendance.  Health officials say in a press release that the person received a positive COVID-19 diagnosis a day after the service. This person is now in home isolation.  BCPH staff contacted attendees and told them to self-quarantine. BCPH is working with healthcare partners to establish testing for all individuals who attended the service.  7:59 a.m. Central California city declared a ‘sanctuary’ from stay-home order  Elected leaders in Atwater, a city of 30,000 in central California, agreed not to enforce the stay-at-home order aimed at slowing the spread of coronavirus.  According to the AP, local authorities will not interfere with any church or business that decides to reopen ahead of state restrictions.  Friday’s declaration was a symbolic gesture of defiance against Gov. Gavin Newsom’s order. The city’s mayor says businesses were taking their own risks by reopening.  6:45 a.m. Lodi winemaker produces new vintage to help find a vaccine  Michael David Winery in Lodi wants to make the search for a COVID-19 vaccine go viral.  It has a new vintage called Going Viral, a 2018 Merlot produced from old vines in a single vineyard.  Winemaker Michael Phillips says sales from Going Viral will go to his daughter’s research. She is a virologist at UC Santa Cruz who is developing diagnostic testing for antibody responses. This could lead to a vaccine for COVID-19.  “One hundred percent of the proceeds go towards her research that she started on coronavirus,” Phillips said. “It wasn’t planned out that way but it’s definitely working and helping her a lot.”  Phillips has bottled 750 cases for sale which customers can pick up at his winery in Lodi or order online for shipping. They’re going for $21 a bottle.  He says people can drink the wine now or wait a year or so to toast the vaccine’s anticipated arrival, though experts are still unsure when that date may be.  Saturday, May 16  12:29 p.m.: $500 state grants available for undocumented Californians beginning Monday  Undocumented adults in California can begin applying for COVID-19 relief grants from the state on Monday.  Those who qualify can receive a $500 cash payment, with a maximum of $1,000 per household.  The grants are available to those who are not eligible for other federal assistance, like the CARES Act stimulus payments or pandemic-related unemployment benefits.  Nonprofit organizations throughout the state were selected to help people apply for and receive the grants. Those who want to apply should contact the nonprofit from their region beginning on Monday, May 18, and no sooner.  Funding is limited — $75 million in total — and recipients will be chosen on a first-come, first-served basis.  More information about the program can be found on the state’s website.  Friday, May 15  5:45 p.m.: J.C. Penney files for bankruptcy as lockdowns take their toll In its 118-year history, J.C. Penney has gone from a Wyoming-based dry-goods store to being a key pillar of the American mall. But like many malls across the country, J.C. Penney has been struggling for some time. The coronavirus lockdowns finally took the department store over the brink. The company said Friday that it\\'s filing for bankruptcy and plans to close some of its stores \"in phases,\" the timing and scale of which will be disclosed \"in coming weeks.\" It\\'s the latest — and likely not the last — retailer whose existing problems led them into bankruptcy during the pandemic, as clothes shopping has fallen off a cliff and the U.S. economy careens into a recession. In April, clothing purchases dove 79% amid a record 16.4% drop in overall retail sales. Preppy retailer J.Crew and luxury department store Neiman Marcus were the first to turn to Chapter 11 proceedings to renegotiate their debt loads amid the coronavirus. Sears, J.C. Penney\\'s historic rival, went into bankruptcy in 2018.  5:04 p.m.: California hospitals say they need a financial boost After two slow business months, California hospitals are disappointed that Gov. Gavin Newsom’s new budget proposal doesn’t include financial support for them. They say without more help, they won’t be ready for a possible second wave of COVID-19 this fall. Erica Murray, who directs the California Association of Public Hospitals and Health Systems, says hospitals have taken a hit. “They cleared out their spaces, both clinical and non-clinical to expand their capacity for a surge, developed their own capacity for testing … all of those things have had a huge impact to public health systems financially,” Murray said. Newsom turned down hospitals’ request for $4 billion to help with staff and equipment needed to both treat COVID-19 and see regular patients long-term. The federal government did give hospitals and clinics $5.3 billion dollars, but the California Hospital Association says it’s not enough. Next, they plan to ask the legislature for support.  8:18 a.m.: USC students pay more for tuition The University of Southern California plans on raising tuition prices by 3.5% for the 2020-2021 school year, whether or not the campus opens for lectures. Annenberg Media reports students will pay $59,260 for tuition, up by more than $2,000 from the year before. A campus spokesperson says school trustees and university leaders decided to keep the tuition hike plan after reviewing financial ramifications from coronavirus. USC may announce plans to reopen classrooms or keep online instruction in June. The California State University System announced this week it would not have in-person classes this fall. 6:45 a.m.: Navy hospital ship leaves Los Angeles A Navy hospital ship that helped out during the coronavirus crisis will depart Los Angeles Harbor Friday, said state officials. The USNS Mercy docked at the end of March, providing beds for non-coronavirus cases. The goal was to take the load off regional medical centers who expected a surge of COVID-19 patients. “Our work to protect public health and safety is far from done, but having the Mercy and its highly-trained medical personnel stationed in the most populous region of the state was critical to our ability to respond in the first stages of the pandemic,” said the California Office of Emergency Services in a statement. Medical teams from the ship will remain in Los Angeles to continue to help with the virus response  Thursday, May 14  6:52 p.m.: California State Fair hosts to-go food event with fair favorites The California State Fair is offering some of fairgoers’ favorite foods to go with a drive-thru meal pick-up event next Friday at the California Letters. The family-style meal includes smoked BBQ brisket, country baked beans, mac \\'n\\' cheese and funnel cake fries. “The California State Fair team has received an influx of messages from Fair-goers expressing their sadness for missing out on this year’s Fair food,” a press release about the event reads. “The team collaborated together with on-site caterer, Spectra, to come up with a plan and menu.” People must pre-order their meals online by midnight Tuesday, May 19, and then pick them up on Friday, May 22, between 4 and 6 p.m. The State Fair says Cal Expo and Spectra have taken precautions to make the event safe. Guests will pull up next to the California Letters at Cal Expo’s Main Gate and open their trunk or unlock their passenger door. A Spectra team member will handle food placement and guests will remain in their car. Guests are encouraged to pre-order early because there are a limited number of meals and no day-of meal purchases. Tickets were offered first to State Fair newsletter subscribers, and more than 200 meals have already been sold. Tickets can be purchased and more information can be found at CalExpoStateFair.com. Plans are already underway for another drive-thru event for May 29.  5:20 p.m.: California K-12 schools, community colleges face biggest cuts in Newsom’s revised budget proposal California’s huge budget shortfall means K-12 schools and community colleges face the biggest decline in revenue — as much as $19 billion — compared with Newsom’s January plan. Overall, Gov. Gavin Newsom said on Thursday “the current projected investment” in K-12 schools and community colleges is $70.5 billion. That’s down 13 percent from last year’s $81.1 billion and even more from the $84 billion proposed in January. Jeff Freitas, president of the California Federation of Teachers, said the proposed budget cuts could jeopardize the ability to reopen schools in the fall. Opening safely means spending more, not less, he said. “We need testing of our students, our staff before they get there,” added Freitas, whose union represents 120,000 teachers and staff at public and private schools across the state. “We need to continue to trace if there becomes a situation, not only in our schools but in our communities. We need to be able to provide, once we can demonstrate that highly reduced risk of reopening our schools, that we need additional social distancing resources, PPE resources, cleaning supplies. There are many more things that we need to add, not subtract, in reopening our schools.” Earlier this month, Newsom said K-12 schools could reopen by July or August. Freitas said that’s going to be a district-by-district decision and that some parts of the state with fewer cases of COVID-19 could be ready before others. He said he could not estimate when all school districts might be able to open their campuses again.  4:47 p.m.: LA now requires face coverings when outside Everyone in Los Angeles must bring face coverings with them when they go outdoors and wear them anytime they\\'re around people from outside their household. The new order issued by Mayor Eric Garcetti is intended to slow the spread of the coronavirus as the easing of other restrictions allows people to return to work and recreation. “Face coverings help stop the spread of the virus, and wearing them in public creates a layer of protection,” the order reads. “However, a face covering is not a substitute for other critical measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 — most importantly, staying home as much as possible, washing hands frequently, and practicing safe physical distancing of at least 6 feet in all settings.” The easing of the “safer at home” orders issued by the city of Los Angeles and Los Angeles County began last week and allows curbside pickup for virtually all retail and limited access to beaches, trails and other outdoor areas.  2:10 p.m.: Newsom calls on Congress to pass coronavirus relief to avoid state budget cuts Today Gov. Gavin Newsom presented a revised budget proposal designed to address the state\\'s projected $54 billion deficit. The $203 billion budget is $19 billion below what he presented in January. Many of the cuts hinge on whether or not the Trump administration offers California additional federal assistance, the governor said. “If the federal government does what it must do under the circumstances to help states large and small all across the nation, that these cuts would go away,” Newsom said. Specifically, he encouraged Congress to pass The HEROES Act, introduced by Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, which would allocate nearly $1 trillion for states and cities. If that money does not come through, Newsom said automatic cuts would be triggered. Republican leaders have criticized the bill, dismissing many of the proposals in the plan, according to NPR. \"This is nothing more than a messaging exercise from House Democrats,\" said Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D. \"It is an effort to try and create talking points for the 2020 election. It\\'s not going anywhere, and we know that.\" Read more about Newsom\\'s proposed budget.  7:10 a.m. Live horse racing resumes at California racetracks  A handful of racetracks in California have been given the green light to resume live horse racing for the first time since California issued its stay-at-home orders.  The Associated Press reports Golden Gate Fields in Berkeley will hold live racing events starting Thursday. According to CBS 5 in San Francisco, no spectators will be allowed at the racetrack.  Los Angeles County health officials will allow live horse racing at Santa Anita on Friday. Track organizers established a restricted zone, which will house jockeys, valets and other staff members. All must test negative for COVID-19 to have access.  6:48 a.m. Eighteen counties set to relax coronavirus restrictions  As of Thursday, the California Department of Public Health says Yuba and Sutter counties are among the 18 counties eligible to move to Stage 2 in California’s reopening plan.  Community centers, schools, dine-in restaurants and destination retail are among the establishments allowed to reopen under the Expanded Stage 2.  Gov. Gavin Newsom says tourists could be one of the pitfalls in reopening the state county-by-county.  \"This is the big challenge: You open up a dense urban environment right next door to a community that\\'s not opened, people start rushing into that dense urban environment and coming back into their community,\" he said.  Wednesday, May 13  5:31 p.m.: California could immediately pull liquor licenses of restaurants reopening too quickly California is allowing restaurants in some counties to re-open in a limited capacity, but regulators say some are moving too quickly. Now, the state wants to crack down on scofflaw businesses. The Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control currently has the power to suspend or revoke liquor licenses. But the process can take months if a business appeals. A proposed rule would allow the department to penalize bars and restaurants immediately, even if they file an appeal. ABC says it would improve public safety against the spread of COVID-19. More counties are expected to let dine-in restaurants reopen after Gov. Gavin Newsom announced new guidelines this week. In March, ABC began letting restaurants sell alcoholic beverages to-go, in an effort to help distressed businesses stay afloat.  4:45 p.m.: Stanislaus County votes to defy stay-at-home order Another county is defying the state on when to reopen. Stanislaus County Supervisors have rescinded the governor’s stay-at-home order reopening restaurants, hair salons, and retail stores. The decision was backed by the county\\'s public health director who cited the risk as low. Supervisor Terry Withrow says the reopening only applies to the unincorporated areas of the county and each city will have to decide its own guidelines. “Businesses, hair salons, bars, restaurants, they could be subject to the governor coming in and pulling their licenses and we can’t do anything about that,\" Withrow said. \"I can’t imagine the governor starting to do that, send people out, and shutting down restaurants.” Withrow says the exception to the reopening are mass gatherings such as movie theaters and concert events which won’t be allowed yet.  2:13 p.m.: California tourism spending could be cut in half, analysts forecast Add tourism to the list of industries taking a huge hit from the coronavirus pandemic. California visitors spent $145 billion last year, up about 3% from 2018. This year, analysts predict travel spending will be slashed to about half that amount, only around $72 billion. The company Tourism Economics anticipates the pandemic will erase 10 years of growth in California\\'s tourism-related spending, state and local tax revenue and jobs created. The latest figures from research firm Dean Runyan show tourism made up more than 10% of the labor force in 15 California counties. Visit California, the state\\'s tourism booster agency, says travel-related economic losses from the pandemic have been hardest on tourism workers, rural destinations in which tourism dominates the economy and hundreds of cities that use hotel taxes to pay for police, fire and other basic municipal services.  7:13 a.m. Napolitano: End use of SAT, ACT for UC admissions  UC President Janet Napolitano wants to end the use of SAT and ACT scores as admission requirements for universities in the system, according to a plan released this week, the AP reports.  In her five year plan for the UC system, Napolitano recommends that it suspends the current SAT and ACT test requirements until 2024 and “create a new test that better aligns with the content UC expects applicants to have learned and with UC values.  Napolitano submitted that plan Monday ahead of a Board of Regents meeting set for May 21. Regents may vote on the proposal at this meeting.  With high school campuses closed because of the coronavirus pandemic, the UC system has made the tests optional for students who want to attend in fall 2021. Napolitano is recommending the universities remain test-optional through 2022 at least..  6:50 a.m.: California pharmacies to test for COVID-19  Pharmacies in California will now be allowed to collect specimens and order COVID-19 tests.  During Tuesday’s press conference, Gov. Gavin Newsom said the State Board of Pharmacy will oversee the rollout with help from the Department of Consumer Affairs.  “There are protocols and procedures, appropriate protective gear, making sure that we isolate folks that may be symptomatic, may be asymptomatic... we obviously have to work through all those, that will be done on each site,” said Newsom.  The state is now testing about 35,000 people a day for COVID-19. The goal is to ramp that up to 60,000 daily tests soon.  6:34 a.m.: Los Angeles County reopens beaches  In the latest easing of coronavirus restrictions that have closed many California public spaces and businesses for nearly two months, Los Angeles County reopens its beaches today.  The AP reports county beaches and many city-owned beaches along the 75 miles of Los Angeles County coastline are reopening with social distancing rules designed to reduce the spread of coronavirus.  Elected leaders warn that beaches could close again if people crowd the shoreline.  “Please, hit the beach, do your thing, and leave. No hanging out for this first phase,” said Redondo Beach Mayor Bill Brand in a Facebook post.  Tuesday, May 12  3:39 p.m.: In-person classes cancelled at all California State University campuses for fall The California State University system’s 23 campuses have cancelled in-person classes for the fall, CSU Chancellor Timothy White announced Tuesday. “This approach to virtual planning is necessary for many reasons. First and foremost is the health, safety and welfare of our students, faculty and staff, and the evolving data surrounding the progression of COVID-19 – current and as forecast throughout the 2020-21 academic year,” White said in a statement. “Said another way, this virtual planning approach preserves as many options for as many students as possible.” Students will continue to attend classes online for the fall, with some exceptions made for laboratory classes and training for students entering healthcare careers. The California State University system is one of the largest public university systems in the country. In addition to CSU schools, which includes Sacramento State, the Los Rios Community College District has also announced that fall classes will be online-only. Gov. Gavin Newsom has begun to slowly reopen the state with so-called low-risk retail opening this past weekend. He also has announced he would like to see K-12 students return to school as soon as July in some communities. Sacramento State president Robert Nelson said in a statement that the University would be following the Chancellor’s mandate, but that they would be putting in a formal process for making exceptions. “Sacramento State is, accordingly, developing a plan for the vast, vast majority of classes to be virtual for Fall 2020. We also are developing a plan for vetting exceptions,” he said. Sacramento State also announced they would be holding summer training for professors to prepare them for virtual teaching in the fall.  8:45 a.m.: Major League Baseball proposing starting 2020 season in July without fans  The owners of Major League Baseball are set to submit a proposal to the players’ union to start the league’s 2020 season in July, without fans in the stands, NPR reports  If the proposal is approved, spring training would start in early to mid-June and Opening Day would take place around July 4 weekend.  In his daily press briefing yesterday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom answered a question about the potential July restart date and said he’d spoken to MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred.  \"He said we won\\'t do anything that\\'s inconsistent with state guidelines\" Newsom said, adding, \"We\\'ll see where we will be in July.\"  Washington Nationals pitcher Sean Doolittle expressed concerns about the safety of the plan in a Tweet Monday.  The July restart proposal lays out health and safety protocols for players and other employees attending games, according to a source with knowledge of the plan. MLB owners are set to meet with the players’ union Tuesday.  7:01 a.m.: California state Senate to consider requiring businesses to accept cash payments  More California businesses are going cashless over fears the exchange of money could cause coronavirus to spread between customers and workers. This could change with a state Senate bill that would require businesses to accept payments in cash.  Democratic state Sen. Jerry Hill authored the proposal. He said the coronavirus outbreak has strengthened his commitment to the bill.  “Essential workers, those on the front lines of keeping our economy and our care services going during the pandemic, they really fall within the populations that are most impacted by cashless payments,” Hill said.  6:34 a.m.: California restaurants awaiting new rules to reopen  Gov. Gavin Newsom is expected to provide details Tuesday on what California restaurants need to do in order to reopen dining rooms that have been closed since mid-March, the AP reports.  His statewide order for restaurants and other businesses to close was aimed at slowing the spread of COVID-19.  Many restaurants say they are already practicing safety procedures they anticipate will be required to reopen. Other food businesses are sanitizing seats, surfaces and doorknobs and removing tables to ensure social distancing.  \\u200b\\u200b  Monday, May 11  6:09 p.m.: More than two dozen counties ask for approval to loosen restrictions Gov. Gavin Newsom says more than two dozen counties have asked permission to loosen their stay-at-home plans beyond what the state allows. On Monday Newsom promised a speedy review and said some counties could have their plans approved by Tuesday. The governor loosened the statewide stay-at-home order last week to allow some retailers and manufacturers to reopen with restrictions. He said counties can go further if they meet strict state standards, but densely populated counties are having difficulty meeting the requirements. Newsom said he would consider adjusting those standards, and that some large counties have special circumstances that must be taken into account. The governor also announced that the Western States Pact — including California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada and Colorado — is requesting $1 trillion in coronavirus relief air from Congress.  4:05 p.m.: Nevada declares fiscal emergency State governments are bracing for deep budget cuts as a result of a recession caused by COVID-19 related business closures. On Monday Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak declared a fiscal emergency due to the coronavirus pandemic. Nevada faces an estimated shortfall of at least $741 million for the current fiscal year. Gov. Steve Sisolak took the first step in preparing the state by declaring the fiscal state of emergency. The declaration allows officials to access the state’s rainy day fund. Sisolak also joined a letter sent by other governors in the Western States Pact asking Congress for $1 trillion in aid to states.  8:08 a.m.: New poll shows majority of Americans disapprove of stay-at-home order protests  Most Americans disapprove of protests against restrictions aimed at preventing the spread of the COVID-19, according to a new poll from the University of Chicago Divinity School and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs.  Researchers found 55% of Americans say they disapprove of such protests, while 31% approve of the demonstrations. 14% of people surveyed say they neither approve nor disapprove.  Over the past month, California’s State Capitol in downtown Sacramento has been the site of a few protests against the statewide stay-at-home order.  7:07 a.m.: Orange County beach reopens today  As parts of California take baby steps toward reopening public spaces and businesses amid the coronavirus pandemic, a beach bordering two Southern California counties will reopen Monday with some restrictions under an agreement reached with the state.  The Associated Press reports Seal Beach in northern Orange County will allow running, walking and surfing. Seal Beach will be open Monday through Thursday during daylight hours, but only for active use. People aren’t allowed to gather, sit or lie on the beach.  Next door, the sand in Long Beach will remain off-limits like the rest of the beaches along the Los Angeles County coast.  Those beaches could reopen as early as Wednesday with restrictions.  Saturday, May 9  4:05 p.m.: Free COVID-19 testing available for all Sacramento County adults who complete online screening  As of May 6, anyone 18 years old or older \\u200bliving in Sacramento County can get tested for COVID-19 after completing an online screening survey.

       "'Shelves where disinfectant wipes are usually displayed is nearly empty at a Target store on March 02, 2020 in Novato, California.  County officials said the patient was likely exposed during international travel from Feb. 11 to Feb. 21 on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco and traveled to Mexico. Placer County officials said the patient arrived at Kaiser Permanente Roseville Medical Center by ambulance on Feb. 27 and was in isolation at the hospital.  \"We extend our deepest condolences to the loved ones of this patient,\" Placer County Health Officer Dr. Aimee Sisson said in a statement. \"While we have expected more cases, this death is an unfortunate milestone in our efforts to fight this disease, and one that we never wanted to see.\"  The patient was an elderly adult with underlying health conditions, county officials said, adding that the person was the second confirmed COVID-19 case in the county and is now the first death related to the virus in the state.  As of Wednesday, there are 53 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in California, including 24 from repatriation flights. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, California has more cases of the virus than any other state.  Placer County, which is in northern California near Sacramento, is monitoring ten health care workers from the hospital, the county said, and five emergency responders who were exposed prior to the patient being placed in isolation. The county said none of them are exhibiting symptoms. The county said other passengers from the cruise may have also been exposed.  \"While most cases of COVID-19 exhibit mild or moderate symptoms,\" Dr. Sisson added, \"this tragic death underscores the urgent need for us to take extra steps to protect residents who are particularly vulnerable to developing more serious illness, including elderly persons and those with underlying health conditions.\"  The news comes after Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the U.S. response to the COVID-19 outbreak, announced the country\\'s tenth death. CNBC has confirmed that the tenth death was in Washington state, where all of the first nine deaths occurred as well.  \"The state is working with federal officials to follow up on contact tracing of individuals that may have been exposed to provide treatment and protect public health,\" California Gov. Gavin Newsom said. \"This case demonstrates the need for continued local, state and federal partnership to identify and slow the spread of this virus.\"  Earlier Wednesday, Los Angeles-area officials announced six new COVID-19 cases in the county over the past 48 hours, prompting that southern California county to declare a local emergency to help free up federal and state funding. Officials said at the announcement that there were no community spread cases in Los Angeles county, meaning that all cases could be traced back to a known or suspected source.'"

       "'Coronavirus Deaths In Washington State And California, Where Gov. Declares Emergency  Enlarge this image toggle caption Rich Pedroncelli/AP Rich Pedroncelli/AP  Updated at 8:45 p.m. ET  The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 has risen to 11 people, after officials reported fatalities in California and Washington state on Wednesday. The most recent death is connected to a cruise ship that traveled from the U.S. to Mexico.  Officials in Placer County, Calif., announced that an elderly resident has become the first person to die from the illness in California. The patient, who was not identified, had underlying health conditions, according to the county.  The patient tested positive for the coronavirus illness on Tuesday and \"was likely exposed during international travel from Feb. 11-21 on a Princess cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico,\" according to a statement published on Placer County\\'s website.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Justin Sullivan/Getty Images  Roughly a week passed from the end of the cruise to when the patient was hospitalized, officials say. An ambulance took the patient to a hospital on Feb. 27; in the interval, the person had \"minimal community exposure,\" the county says. The patient had been in isolation at Kaiser Permanente Roseville.  Gov. Gavin Newsom extended his condolences to the patient\\'s loved ones and said the state is working with federal agencies to trace people who might have had contact with the patient. Later Wednesday, Newsom declared a state of emergency over coronavirus in California, which has more than 50 confirmed cases, according to health officials.  Placer County spans a wide area, from the outskirts of Sacramento to Lake Tahoe.  Among California\\'s cases are 24 people who arrived in the U.S. on repatriation flights from outbreak locations in Asia.  The other cases include seven people who were infected via person-to-person exposure and 12 travel-related cases.  \"Approximately 515 persons have been tested to date,\" the California Department of Public Health says.  To prevent the virus from spreading, health experts recommend washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or using a hand sanitizer. Face masks should be worn only by people who are either sick or are caring for someone who is, according to the World Health Organization.  Washington state  Washington state raised its own death toll from COVID-19 to 10 people earlier Wednesday. The state now has 39 confirmed cases of the coronavirus disease, with 31 of them in Seattle and King County. The other eight cases are in neighboring Snohomish County.  Many of the cases are linked to Life Care Center of Kirkland, Wash., the long-term care facility northeast of Seattle that is at the center of the outbreak in King County.  On Wednesday afternoon, officials in Seattle and King County issued recommendations for vulnerable residents to try to contain the spread of coronavirus in the area.  \"People at higher risk of severe illness should stay home and away from large groups of people as much as possible, including public places with lots of people and large gatherings where there will be close contact with others,\" they said in a statement.  That group includes people 60 and older; people with underlying health conditions such as heart disease, lung disease or diabetes; those with weakened immune systems; and people who are pregnant.  In addition, officials said companies should take steps to allow employees to work from home, if possible, and recommended that people avoid visiting hospitals, long-term care facilities and nursing homes.  More than 230 people in Washington state are under supervision out of concern that they may have been exposed to the pathogen, the Washington Department of Health says.  Los Angeles declares emergency  Hours before Gov. Newsom declared an emergency for the entire state, the city of Los Angeles declared a health emergency over the coronavirus, citing the need to address the possibility of community transmission of the disease that has caused more than 3,200 deaths globally.  The move comes after Los Angeles County confirmed six new cases of the coronavirus and seven overall, according to Dr. Barbara Ferrer, director of the Los Angeles County Department of Public Health.  \"I have signed a declaration of local emergency for the City of Los Angeles,\" Mayor Eric Garcetti announced via Facebook. \"While there are only a few known active COVID-19 cases in the region, the declaration helps us access state and federal funding to strengthen and support our efforts to prepare our region and keep our communities safe.\"  Los Angeles County mirrored the city\\'s move, in a step that the chair of the county\\'s board of supervisors, Kathryn Barger, said was a planned reaction to the virus.  \"This is not a response rooted in panic,\" Barger said, adding that the emergency declaration would help agencies coordinate their response and contain the virus in a county where more than 10 million people live.  One person has been hospitalized while five others are being monitored at home, Ferrer said. The county\\'s first patient, a Chinese national who was diagnosed in January, has recovered from the virus, she said.  \"Three of the new cases were travelers who were traveling together in northern Italy,\" Ferrer said at a news conference. Two others are relatives of a person who was infected with the coronavirus outside of the county, she said. The sixth case is a person who works in a field that exposes them to international travelers, Ferrer added.  Later Wednesday, the Los Angeles Times reported that a worker at the city\\'s international airport who screened incoming flights from China and nearby countries had tested positive for the virus.  Cases rise in U.S.  There are at least 80 confirmed cases of COVID-19 that originated in the U.S., the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier Wednesday. That number doesn\\'t include the 49 Americans diagnosed with COVID-19 who have been repatriated from outbreaks in Wuhan, China, and aboard the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  At least 13 states have reported coronavirus cases since late January.  While international travel has been linked to 24 of the U.S. cases, the cause of transmission is still under investigation in 40 cases. Person-to-person spread in the U.S. has caused infection in 16 cases, according to the CDC .  The CDC data reflects numbers that were reported by 4 p.m. ET the previous day — meaning the actual number of cases in the U.S. might be higher than the most recent posting by the agency.  \"States are now testing and publicly reporting their cases,\" the CDC says. \"In the event of a discrepancy, state case counts are the most up to date.\"  In addition to California and Washington, other states reporting coronavirus cases include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Texas and Wisconsin.  Although Texas previously had cases from people returning from China or who had been aboard the Diamond Princess, officials on Wednesday reported a newly detected infection in a person who had recently traveled aboard.  \"Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn\\'t change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low,\" said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. \"This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting limit the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.\"'"

       "'At least 11 Americans dead from coronavirus; California declares state of emergency More than 100 Americans have contracted coronavirus, Pence said.  Countries around the world are scrambling to stymie the spread of a deadly viral outbreak that began in China about two months ago and has now infected more than 90,000 people globally.  Today\\'s biggest developments:  Pence says insurance will cover COVID-19 tests  11 Americans have been killed by virus, including the first death in California  1,000 people in New York have self-quarantined  New Hampshire\\'s 1st patient told to stay isolated but went to event instead, officials say  Outbreak in South Korea shows little signs of slowing down  COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu, WHO says  Here\\'s how the day unfolded. All times are Eastern.  7:30 p.m. California declares state of emergency  Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency after announcing California had 53 confirmed cases of novel coronavirus, including one death.  The deceased patient was a resident of Placer County and aboard a Princess cruise ship that traveled from San Francisco to Mexico last month. The boat is currently at sea and is slated to return to San Francisco soon.  Newsom said he delayed the cruise ship’s arrival to give federal officials more time to prepare. The CDC will be flying testing kits to the cruise ship before being turned around in a matter of hours on shore.  6 p.m. Pence calls COVID-19 tests \\'essential health benefit\\'  Medicare and Medicaid, in addition to private insurers, will cover tests for the coronavirus because such examinations are an essential health benefit, Vice President Mike Pence said.  Pence didn\\'t elaborate on what would happen for uninsured Americans.  5:30 p.m. 2nd California cruise passenger diagnosed  Diamond Cruises revealed a second passenger aboard the Feb. 11 to 21 voyage of the Grand Princess has contracted the coronavirus.  The Sonoma County, California, resident showed atypical \"gastrointestinal and cardiovascular symptoms,\" the company said.  A Grand Princess passenger who lived in Placer County died from the disease, according to health officials.  5 p.m. LAX health screener tests positive  A medical screener at LAX Airport in Los Angeles has tested positive for the virus, according to the Department of Homeland Security.  The screener, whose last shift at the airport was on Feb. 21, began experiencing flu-like symptoms about eight days later, according to DHS. The individual at that point visited a doctor and tested positive.  \"We are told the individual wore all the correct protective equipment and took necessary protections on the job,\" DHS spokeswoman Heather Swift said in a statement.  DHS said it\\'s working to identify which coworkers the individual came in contact with and whether the virus was contracted from a traveler.  4:30 p.m. Seattle confirms 10 new cases  Seattle health officials said the city\\'s latest coronavirus death is among the 10 cases confirmed on Wednesday.  The patient who died was described as a woman in her 90s who lived at Life Care, the nursing home at which multiple cases and deaths have been reported.  4:15 p.m. Italy bans fans from sports stadiums  Italy\\'s government has declared that sporting events will continue but fans won\\'t be allowed to attend, because of fears over the coronavirus.  The decision will cover all matches, mostly soccer and rugby, over the next month. Six matches in the nation\\'s top-flight soccer league, Serie A, were postponed last week.  4 p.m. Dow adds almost 1,200 points  After a volatile few weeks amid coronavirus uncertainty, U.S. financial markets rallied sharply on Wednesday.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average soared 1,173.45 points, or 4.53%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq each 4.22% and 3.85%, respectively. The surge came after massive losses Tuesday despite the Federal Reserve announcing a rare emergency rate cut.  Lawmakers on Wednesday announced an $8 billion deal to help combat the outbreak, a move that also appears to have put more investors at ease.  Among the biggest winners on Wednesday were health insurance companies, possibly due to Joe Biden\\'s big wins on Super Tuesday over Bernie Sanders.  3:52 p.m. 2nd New York family infected  A second family in Westchester, New York, has contracted the coronavirus, according to Gov. Andrew Cuomo.  The father of the family came in contact with the Westchester attorney who had been diagnosed earlier, and contracted the virus along with his wife, two sons and one daughter, Cuomo said. One of the family\\'s daughter\\'s tested negative, the governor said.  The number of confirmed cases in New York state is now 11, and Cuomo warned that the number of infected Westchester residents will increase.  \"It is going to be dozens and dozens and dozens,\" he said.  3 p.m. United reduces flights in April  United Airlines announced it will reduce domestic flight schedules by 10% and international flights by 20% in April due to declining demand.  The airline said it would reveal more specifics about the reductions on Saturday and is mulling a similar reduction in May.  United also is offering employees the option to voluntarily apply for an unpaid leave of absence, instituting a hiring freeze and suspending 2019 merit salary increases until July.  2:25 p.m. 11th person reported dead, 1st in California  Officials in Placer County, California, announced an elderly adult with underlying conditions was the 11th coronavirus death.  The patient was exposed during international travel between Feb. 11 and 21 aboard a Princess Cruise ship that departed from San Francisco to Mexico, according to health officials, who are working to identify and contact other passengers who may have been exposed.  Princess Cruises issued a statement to guests and crew who are currently aboard the ship, the Grand Princess, telling them about the situation and advising guests who sailed on the previous voyage to stay in their stateroom until they are cleared by medical staff. The company said it canceled the boat\\'s docking at Ensenada, Mexico, and will return to San Francisco on Thursday afternoon.  The deceased patient had minimal community exposure between returning from the cruise to their arrival at Kaiser Permanente Roseville Medical Center on Feb. 27, the officials said. However, 10 hospital health care workers and five emergency responders who were exposed to the patient before they were put into isolation are currently under monitored quarantined.  1:40 p.m. 10th coronavirus-related death recorded in US  Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the White House\\'s coronavirus task force, announced that a 10th American has died from the disease. Washington health officials later said the death occurred in King County, where eight other deaths were previously recorded.  Pence did not provide further detail about the patient, but said as of Wednesday afternoon a little more than 100 Americans have contracted the virus. Pence said he and the task force are slated to visit Washington state, where nine of the coronavirus deaths occurred, on Thursday.  1:15 p.m. 1,000 people in self quarantine in New York  New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo gave an update on the coronavirus situation in Westchester County, and said about 1,000 residents have been asked to self-quarantine.  At least eight employees at Lawrence Hospital, where a 50-year-old man who contracted the disease was first admitted, are being tested for the virus, according to Cuomo.  12:56 p.m. $8.3 billion for coronavirus emergency funds  Lawmakers in Washington reached a deal to allocate $8.3 billion towards the response to coronavirus.  The amount is nearly seven times as large as President Donald Trump\\'s request and will fund the government\\'s response, including vaccine development, support for state and local governments and assistance for affected small businesses.  12:39 p.m. Italy to temporarily close schools and universities  Schools and universities in Italy will close beginning Thursday until March 15, authorities announced.  The decision comes as the country grapples with rising confirmed cases of coronavirus and their attempts to contain it. There were 347 new confirmed cases reported in Italy overnight, making the total 2,036, according to the WHO\\'s numbers as of Wednesday.  12:10 p.m. 6 new cases have been confirmed in LA County, state of emergency declared  Officials in Los Angeles County declared a state of emergency as six new positive cases of coronavirus were confirmed there in the last 24 hours.  Kathryn Barger, a supervisor on the county\\'s board, said in a press conference the declaration \"is not a response routed in panic.\" Instead, it will allow local officials to better coordinate with state and federal partners to \"enhance our preparedness,\" she said.  Los Angeles County becomes the second county in the U.S. to declare a state of emergency. King County in Washington, which has reported eight deaths, declared a state of emergency on Monday.  Barbara Ferrer, the county\\'s public health director, said the new cases are all linked to either travel history or a close contact with a confirmed case. There are not yet any known cases of community transmission, according to Ferrer.  11:51 a.m. Hospitals should be more proactive in testing, says member of president\\'s coronavirus task force  Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and a member of the president\\'s coronavirus task force, said he feels \"very strongly\" that hospitals should be testing patients more proactively for coronavirus.  While testifying in a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on the NIH budget, Fauci said the reason hospitals haven\\'t done so yet is because there aren\\'t enough resources to test the virus in every emergency room and health center. However, he noted, the CDC is expanding testing beyond the six sentinel cities it started with.  Fauci also made a point to note that the WHO fatality rate -- 3.4% -- is incomplete because the denominator of asymptomatic cases is currently unknown.  \"If you look at the cases that have come to the attention of the medical authorities in China and you just do the math, the math is about 2%. If you look at certain age groups, certain risk groups, the fatality is much higher, but as a group it\\'s going to depend completely on what the factor of asymptomatic cases are,\" he said.  11:32 a.m. Italy has begun screening US-bound passengers at airports  At airports in Rome and Milan, passengers will have their temperatures taken before departing for the United States amid the coronavirus outbreak, sources told ABC News on Wednesday. The screenings began Tuesday at Rome-Fiumicino and Milan-Malpensa airport, the sources said.  If someone does have a fever, they will be taken aside and not allowed to travel before further tests are carried out. The tests are being administered by the Ministry of Health and the Italian Red Cross. They are similar to ones that have now begun in South Korea.  11:02 a.m. South Korea to start screening US-bound travelers  As part of efforts to contain the coronavirus outbreak, all travelers flying from South Korea to the United States will now have their temperatures checked at their assigned gate at the airport prior to boarding their flight, the South Korean Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport announced Wednesday.  Travelers who have a body temperature higher than 37.5 degrees Celsius (99.5 Fahrenheit) will not be allowed to board their flight. Tickets will be refundable, the ministry said.  10:37 a.m. Case count in New York rises to 6  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in New York state climbed to six on Wednesday.  The four new cases confirmed Wednesday are tied to a 50-year-old patient from New Rochelle in New York\\'s Westchester County. The man\\'s wife, their two children and a neighbor who drove him to the hospital have all tested positive for the novel coronavirus, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference.  The man\\'s son is a 20-year-old student at Yeshiva University in New York City. His daughter is a 14-year-old student at Salanter Akiba Riverdale Academy and High School, known as SAR, in the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx. Both schools announced closures Wednesday upon receiving word of their infections, according to Cuomo.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said the son had not been on Yeshiva University\\'s campus since Feb. 27. Both the son and daughter, as well as their mother, remain at home in isolation.  \"Yeshiva University is working closely with the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene to take every necessary precaution to ensure the safety of students and the community,\" de Blasio said in a statement Wednesday. \"City disease detectives are on campus to identify close contacts of the student and connect those individuals to testing immediately. As of this morning, two contacts have transferred to Bellevue Hospital for testing. We will continue working closely with our state partners to ensure we are doing everything we can to keep New Yorkers safe.\"  Meanwhile, students from both the State University of New York (SUNY) and the City University of New York (CUNY) will be recalled from study abroad programs in China, Iran, Italy, Japan and South Korea, according to Cuomo. They will be flown back to the United States on a chartered plane, which will land at Stewart International Airport in New Windsor, New York. The students will then be quarantined for 14 days in dormitories.  9:50 a.m. Son of New York patient tests positive  A college student in New York has tested positive for the novel coronavirus after his father became infected, officials said.  Yeshiva University in New York City confirmed in a press release Wednesday that the student had tested positive for the newly discovered virus, known officially as COVID-19.  \"Our thoughts and prayers are with him and his family as well as to all those affected,\" the school said in a statement.  As a precautionary measure, the school canceled all Wednesday classes on its Wilf Campus in the Washington Heights neighborhood. All classes and operations at the school\\'s other campuses will continue as normal.  \"This precautionary step will allow us to work with city agencies and other professionals to best prepare our campus,\" the school said, \"and ensure the uncompromised safety of our students, faculty and staff.\"  8:19 a.m. New Hampshire\\'s 1st patient told to stay isolated but went to event instead, officials say  The first confirmed case of the novel coronavirus in New Hampshire is a hospital employee who went to an event despite being told to stay isolated, officials said.  Through the course of an investigation, officials at the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services learned that the patient had attended an invitation-only private event last Friday after being told to self-isolate. The department has issued an official order of isolation to the patient and is contacting attendees who had close contact with the individual during the event to notify them to follow the recommended 14-day self-isolation, according to a press release on Tuesday.  Now, there\\'s a second presumptive positive case involving a person who was in close contact with the state\\'s first patient. The second individual is a man from Grafton County who is currently isolated at home, and state officials have begun tracing his contacts. The New Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services is awaiting confirmation of two presumptive positive test results by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  \"We expect additional cases may be identified that are related to this investigation,\" officials said in the press release.  Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, New Hampshire, confirmed that the state\\'s first patient is an employee.  7:48 a.m. 1st confirmed case at EU office  The first case of the novel coronavirus has been confirmed at a European Union office in Brussels, a spokesperson told ABC News.  The case is a male employee who works at the European Defense Agency and had recently traveled to Italy, where 2,236 people have been infected with the newly identified virus. The man tested positive Tuesday, according to EU press officer Claire Joawn.  6:50 a.m. Outbreak in South Korea shows little signs of slowing down  The South Korean city of Daegu reported another spike in new cases of the novel coronavirus overnight as the outbreak shows little signs of slowing down there.  South Korea\\'s Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recorded an additional 516 confirmed cases in the past 24 hours, bringing the country\\'s total to 5,328. Over 400 of the newly confirmed cases were in Daegu, where a secretive religious sect has been linked to a majority of the country\\'s infections.  South Korea has the second-highest national total of confirmed cases, behind China.  5:45 a.m. COVID-19 is deadlier than the flu, WHO says  The disease caused by the novel coronavirus, known officially as COVID-19, is more than three times as deadly as the season flu, according to the head of the World Health Organization.  \"Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died,\" WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said at a press conference in Geneva on Tuesday. \"By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected.\"  Although the newly identified virus does not spread as easily as the flu, it causes more severe illness and there are currently no vaccines or therapeutics.  \"While many people globally have built up immunity to seasonal flu strains, COVID-19 is a new virus to which no one has immunity,\" Tedros said. \"That means more people are susceptible to infection, and some will suffer severe disease.\"  3:30 a.m. New presumptive positive case reported in Northern California  Public health officials in Northern California\\'s Placer County have reported a second case of the novel coronavirus after a hospitalized patient tested \"presumptively positive,\" pending confirmation from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In a press release issued late Tuesday night, Placer County Public Health said the patient is an older adult whose exposure to the newly identified virus, known officially as COVID-19, likely occurred during their time on a Princess Cruises ship that traveled from San Francisco to Mexico last month. It\\'s the same cruise associated with a confirmed case announced previously in Sonoma County.  \"As the case appears connected to travel, it most likely does not represent an instance of local community spread,\" Placer County Public Health said in the press release.  The Placer County patient is critically ill and in isolation at a local hospital. Close contacts of the individual are being quarantined and monitored.  The county has declared a local health emergency as well as a local emergency.  “We expect to see additional cases in coming days, including cases of community spread, not linked to travel,\" said Health Officer Dr. Aimee Sisson. “We are declaring these emergencies today so we will be able to activate and deploy resources to adequately respond to an increase in cases.\"  As of Tuesday, the CDC counted 108 confirmed and presumptive positive cases of COVID-19 in the United States. That number includes 60 Americans whose cases were confirmed by the local U.S. health systems, 45 who were repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined off the coast of Japan and three who were repatriated from Wuhan, China, where the virus emerged back in December.  So far, nine people sickened with the virus in the United States have died.  More than 80,000 people have been infected with the virus in China, mostly in central Hubei province, which includes Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak, and nearly 3,000 of them have died. Meanwhile, over 10,000 have tested positive for the virus in 72 other nations and 166 have died, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization, which has declared the outbreak a global health emergency.

       "\"This illustration provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in January 2020 shows the 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV).  Updated April 17, 5:17 p.m.  With the continued spread of COVID-19 in California, there are a lot of questions about how the disease caused by the coronavirus works and what people should do. Here are some answers from experts and public health officials about what the public should know.  How worried do I need to be?  The United States nationally is in the acceleration phase of the pandemic, according to the CDC. The immediate risk of being exposed to this virus is still low for most Americans, but as the outbreak expands, that risk will increase. In the coming months, most of the U.S. population will be exposed to this virus.  People in places where ongoing community spread of the virus that causes COVID-19 has been reported are at elevated risk of exposure, with the level of risk dependent on the location.  You can keep track of the number of reported cases and deaths over time in your county using this California Coronavirus Tracker. You can also examine the prevalence of certain risk factors for more serious COVID-19 cases in your county.  What are the symptoms of COVID-19?  The symptoms of infection with the coronavirus are very similar to the symptoms of the flu. They include fever, a cough and shortness of breath, according to the CDC.  Symptoms may appear in as little as two days and as long as 14 days after exposure. The vast majority of people who are infected with the coronavirus will experience mild symptoms or may even be asymptomatic, UC Davis pediatric infectious disease specialist Dr. Dean Blumberg said.  How does it spread? What can I do to help limit the spread?  According to the CDC, the virus that causes the illness mainly spreads person to person, such as:  When two people are in close contact with one another  When one person inhales the respiratory droplets from an infected person’s cough or sneeze  When one person touches a surface where the virus lives and then touches their nose or mouth  Experts believe people are the most contagious at the peak of their symptoms, though some spread might be possible before symptoms arise.  To help limit spread, wash your hands frequently. Health officials also say to:  Resist touching your own nose or mouth with unwashed hands  Avoid close contact with people who are sick  Stay home if you develop a fever, cough or other respiratory symptoms  California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered all residents to stay home except for essential business, like getting food or picking up prescriptions. The state also advises “social distancing” — a practice of keeping six feet between you and other people to stop or slow the spread of infectious diseases.    Take some precautionary measures like avoiding contact with sick individuals, washing your hands often with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, and getting a flu shot. Since COVID-19 symptoms are similar to the flu, it is another important reason to get a flu shot.  Who is most vulnerable to becoming severely ill if infected with the coronavirus?  Older adults and people with chronic medical conditions like heart or lung disease or diabetes are more at risk of coronavirus infection and of developing severe symptoms from an infection. Health care workers, close contacts of those infected and people who have traveled to infection hotspots are also at an elevated risk of exposure.  Kids, so far, seem less vulnerable to coronavirus infection and have even milder symptoms than most adults, according to NPR.  Can COVID-19 be spread through packages sent via mail from China?  There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 can be spread through imported goods, and there have not been any cases of it associated with imported goods in the U.S.  The CDC says that there is likely a very low risk of spread through products and packaging shipped over days and weeks at ambient temperatures from China. Two past coronaviruses, MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV, had very poor survivability on surfaces (like packages and products).  What does community transmission mean?  Community transmission refers to situations where the source of infection is unknown, or cannot be pinpointed.  Community transmission of COVID-19 has been identified in California since late February, according to the California Department of Public Health, and since early March, most of the confirmed cases in the state were not related to travel outside of the United States.  What should I do if I think I’m experiencing symptoms of COVID-19? Should I go to the doctor, the hospital, or wait it out?  If you are sick, you should stay at home, except to get medical care.  Sacramento County Public Health Director Dr. Peter Beilenson recommended that people avoid hospitals, emergency rooms or doctors’ offices unless they really need to go, in order to lessen exposure to the virus and other illnesses like the cold and flu.  “If someone feels ill, the best thing to do is contact your physician, and he or she will take a travel history of you and a more broad symptomatic history of you,” Bielenson said. “I surmise that over time, the vast majority of people with this infection will be treated at home, just as with the flu.”  You should also separate yourself from other people in your home. This is known as home isolation. Avoid sharing personal items, clean surfaces often and monitor your symptoms. Find more advice from the CDC here.  Should I cancel my upcoming travel plans?  The CDC currently recommends avoiding all nonessential travel to China, Iran, most European countries, the United Kingdom and Ireland, including layovers in these locations.  It also recommends that older adults and those with chronic medical conditions consider postponing nonessential travel to most global destinations because COVID-19 can be more serious for those groups.  On March 9 it recommended all people, especially those with underlying health conditions, avoid traveling on cruise ships.  NPR is updating a map on CDC travel advisories here.  You can find more travel information from the CDC here. Above all, travel brings you into contact with lots of people, especially on cruises or airplanes, so frequent hand washing is recommended.  How many people in the United States and in California have tested positive for the virus?  The number of cases in the United States and California is changing rapidly. The CDC is updating U.S. cases here. You can keep track of the number of reported cases and deaths over time in your county using this California Coronavirus Tracker.  On March 4, California Gov. Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency.  On March 8, the state released guidelines for school districts and for organizers of public events.  On March 11 the state advised against gatherings of more than 250 people.  On March 15, the state recommended home isolation for seniors 65 and older and asked bars, nightclubs, breweries and wineries to close.  On March 19, Newsom ordered all California's nearly 40 million residents to stay at home to slow the spread of the coronavirus.  On April 3, the CDC recommended that all Americans wear cloth or fabric face coverings while in public.  On April 14, Gov. Newsom introduced a six-point plan for how California might gradually lift its stay-home order.  Follow us for more stories like this\""

       "'Use Our Content This story can be republished for free ( details ).  Just weeks into the federal government’s efforts to contain the novel coronavirus, a new California case has exposed weaknesses in the testing procedures that could be masking more widespread reach of the disease.  A woman in Solano County, California, who hadn’t traveled abroad or had contact with another known patient with the illness was diagnosed with the virus Wednesday, raising concerns that cases are going undetected because of the federal government’s narrow testing protocols.  The patient sought care at a local hospital before being transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento because of the severity of her case, according to a letter hospital officials sent to members of the campus community. Suspecting coronavirus, doctors at UC Davis asked public health officials about testing for COVID-19, the name given to the illness believed to have originated in Wuhan, China.  Email Sign-Up Subscribe to KHN’s free Morning Briefing.  But the request did not meet protocols laid out by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: The woman didn’t have a history of travel or contact with a person with a known infection. So no test was administered. The patient continued to receive treatment at UC Davis for four more days, without a diagnosis. Finally, on Sunday, the CDC requested the test, according to the letter.  It came back positive.  Multiple experts interviewed said the case underscores the need for more widespread community testing of the new coronavirus, which has sickened tens of thousands of people in more than 45 nations around the globe. It also highlights how the CDC’s narrow testing protocols, combined with the agency’s continued delays in getting functional coronavirus test kits to state and local public health agencies, have hindered the public health system’s ability to respond to the outbreak.  To date, the CDC has tested fewer than 500 people in the U.S. for the virus. By contrast, South Korea, which is several days into an outbreak, had tested more than 66,000 people and confirmed more than 1,700 cases as of Thursday morning.  The Northern California case mirrors what some experts have been warning for weeks: that infected people might be circulating undetected in the general population because the testing criteria are too narrow. It’s highly likely the Solano County case is not unique, and that other cases of what is called community transmission are going undetected, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at John Hopkins Center for Health Security. He stressed, however, that the risk of infection remains low in the U.S.  Officials declined to provide details about the patient’s age or condition, citing privacy concerns. Some health care workers at the facility have been asked to stay home “out of an abundance of caution,” hospital officials wrote, and public health officials are working to locate others who may have come into contact with the patient over the last couple of weeks.  At a news conference Thursday, California authorities called for the federal government to ramp up testing of the broader population in light of the Solano County case, thought to be the first evidence in the U.S. of community transmission.  “We need to substantially increase access and availability of testing, and we need to do that today,” said Gov. Gavin Newsom.  Newsom noted that more than 8,400 people in California were being monitored for coronavirus and that 28 people still in the state were confirmed to be infected. Newsom said he had received assurances from CDC officials that they would expand testing protocols, which they did later Thursday.  Until Thursday, testing criteria for COVID-19 said the person should have fever and signs of lower respiratory infection, as well as a recent history of travel to mainland China; or a fever or signs of lower respiratory infection and close contact with someone already diagnosed with the virus. On Thursday, those guidelines were expanded to include people who had those symptoms and had recently traveled to Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea, in addition to China; or people with fever and acute lower respiratory illness that isn’t explained by flu or other viruses.  Like other experts, Adalja believes the testing protocol should be even broader. About 80% of people diagnosed with the virus have only mild symptoms, according to early research out of China, and even under the expanded CDC guidelines, few of those people would qualify for testing.  While the risk to the general population is still believed to be low, finding mild illnesses is the key to understanding how deadly the virus is, and how big a risk it poses.  Given the high rate of travel into and out of the U.S., there’s reason to believe the virus reached the U.S. before there was even a testing protocol in place, Adalja said. He said clinicians need more autonomy to order tests on patients they suspect have the virus.  In addition to the delayed testing in California, news outlets in Hawaii have reported that some tests ordered by physicians there were never processed because they didn’t meet the testing criteria.  And the test kits themselves have had substantial problems. After they were sent to labs three weeks ago, numerous states reported trouble verifying the tests because one component of the kit was flawed. Officials aren’t yet sure of the exact cause of the problem. Meanwhile, all testing has continued to be routed through the CDC in Atlanta, a process that can take several days between packaging, shipping and analyzing.  In the weeks since the faulty kits were sent out, public health agencies have gotten so desperate for a functional test that they took the extraordinary step of asking the FDA to allow them to develop their own. “We are now many weeks into the response with still no diagnostic or surveillance test available outside of CDC for the vast majority of our member laboratories,” the Association of Public Health Laboratories, which coordinates responses from local labs during health emergencies, wrote in a letter to the FDA. The FDA replied, outlining a process for a public health lab-developed test that the APHL plans to use in future outbreaks.  “Next time, we will go straight to the FDA,” said Scott Becker, CEO of the APHL.  Meanwhile, on a call Wednesday with public health labs around the country, the CDC and FDA said that the handful of labs that had verified that the CDC kits they received were fully or largely functional could begin performing tests using those kits. As of Thursday morning, eight labs in seven states fit that category.  California is one of those states. Newsom said that he was concerned by the small number of test kits the state currently had, and that the CDC had assured him more were coming. APHL expects some 40 labs will have testing capabilities by the end of next week, Becker said.  Still, some states flush with international travelers, like New York, have not been able to successfully use the flawed kits. On Wednesday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo called on the federal government to allow testing in New York using a locally developed test that follows CDC protocol.  Too much testing can be a bad thing, which means officials must find an appropriate balance. During the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, local labs were overwhelmed with tests, Becker said, some of which were unnecessary since the virus already was known to be circulating in some communities. “We can’t have every mildly ill person flood the health system.” Newsom echoed this sentiment, urging people to stay calm.  Several weeks ago, the CDC said it would roll out expanded testing through a surveillance network used to test for the flu, but the problems with the tests have delayed the start of the program.  The delays with testing also highlight the need for more consistent funding, so that health departments can be prepared for an outbreak, said Becker. Funding waxes and wanes with epidemics, but public health has to be as ready as your local fire department, he said. “We are that important to the health, safety and economy of the country.”  This KHN story first published on California Healthline, a service of the California Health Care Foundation.'"

       "'Alison Yin/EdSource  As fears escalate across California about a potential outbreak of coronavirus (COVID-19), school districts and college campuses this week moved to quell fears from parents and staff about the growing threat.  The moves come as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention investigates what could be the first case of novel coronavirus involving a person who had not recently traveled outside of the country or come into contact with others who have been abroad.  That patient, from Solano County, is being treated at UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento.  On Thursday, UC Davis Chancellor and Vice Chancellor David Lubarsky said that no one at the medical center or on the main campus has been diagnosed with the virus but said that “out of an abundance of caution” three students who are roommates in a campus dormitory are in isolation. The CDC is testing one of those students, who is currently back home with mild symptoms like a runny nose and a cough. No further details were available.  “We like to think of containing the spread of an infection like some concentric rings, so we know these three students were potentially exposed to coronavirus, so that’s kind of the inner ring,” Ron Chapman, Yolo County Health Officer, said Thursday afternoon. “At this point, it really feels like we have gotten on top of this very early so it does not seem like we would have to expand those rings of investigation.”  As a precaution, daily disinfection practices are being implemented within all student housing and dining properties at UC Davis. There were no plans to cancel classes, although abroad both the University of California and California State University systems have suspended programs in China and Seoul, South Korea.  Across CSU’s 23 campuses and UC’s 10 campuses in California, no students or faculty have been reported as being sick with the virus.  UC president Janet Napolitano bolstered previous warnings about scholars and students traveling to nations affected by the virus and directed “the UC community to temporarily avoid all non-essential, university-related travel to countries that are designated with a CDC Warning — Level 3 Travel Notice.” This currently includes South Korea and China, but not Macau or Hong Kong.  The California Community College system also has asked its colleges to review their emergency operations plans to take into account possible disruptions related to COVID-19.  At Los Rios Community College District in Sacramento, two students at colleges in the district who are medical professionals came into contact with an infected individual last week, according to district officials. The district said the two, who attend Cosumnes River College and American River College, began 14-day self-quarantines on Wednesday on instruction from county health officials, who said the campuses were not at risk.  Across the state, meanwhile, school K-12 officials announced in emails and via social media that they were reviewing emergency operation plans and asked parents to take precautions similar to those taken during flu season.  The novel coronavirus, also called COVID-19, is from the family of viruses that causes the common cold. It causes respiratory ailments and is typically spread by droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes but can be transmitted by touching surfaces. Symptoms can include fever, cough and shortness of breath.  The state Department of Education issued a guidance letter to district and county superintendents saying its top priority was “to diffuse the fear and reassure our communities that schools are prepared and have plans in place.”  Department spokesman Scott Roark said districts are required to have an emergency plan in place but while those can incorporate a pandemic plan such plans are not mandated.  The statement directed officials to state Department of Public Health recommendations that ranged from basic hygiene tips to urging local education agencies to plan for serving students’ learning needs in case of school closures.  For some parents around the state, the rising crescendo of news about the novel coronavirus in California was unnerving.  Tomeko Smith, a resident of Moreno Valley, said she was considering keeping her eight-year-old son and 16-year-old daughter home from school.  “I would like to see them take more safety cautions and prevention,” she said. “I would like to see a virus plan. You really need to prevent things.”  Smith said she gave her son a bottle of hand sanitizer and instructed him to use it every time he touched any surface at the Moreno Valley Unified School District school he attends.  A Moreno Valley spokeswoman said all of the district’s schools are practicing safety measures as they do with other illnesses or respiratory diseases, such as the flu or cold, with a special emphasis on hand washing with soap, which health officials say is one of the most effective preventative measures.  Officials in various school districts in Sacramento County reported only a handful of calls from concerned parents. Districts responded in different ways, some offering links to the county health department website, others sending notices, posting tweets and publishing material on their websites.  In Solano County, where scores of passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship were taken to Travis Air Force Base for coronavirus quarantine, the Travis Unified School District in Fairfield issued a statement Thursday saying it was notified by the CDC “to urge our sites to prepare for possible 2019 Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreaks.”  The district urged citizens to remain calm, assuring that all school facilities were routinely being cleaned according to standard protocol.  “While this may be alarming to some parents, the risk to Solano County residents and the general public is still low at this time,” the statement read.  Los Angeles County Superintendent of Schools Debra Duardo in an online video statement assured the public that her office would be working with school districts “to identify and develop plans to support the education of our students should schools or districts need to close for any reason.”  No details about what those plans might entail were available.  The San Juan Unified School District in Sacramento County was offering much the same information and links to health services websites.  The district’s health services and student support services departments have been communicating with the county Department of Public Health, but the district leaders plan to convene a larger group next week to begin planning in case the virus continues to spread, said Raj Rai, district spokeswoman.  The district, which had to close an elementary school last year when students fell ill from norovirus, launched a similar planning team when H1N1, or the swine flu, was prominent.  “We may never get to that level, but it is good to have that in case,” Rai said. “We don’t want to be caught off guard if it comes to that point.”  Gov. Gavin Newsom on Thursday held a press conference, acknowledging that 33 people in California have been diagnosed with the virus. Newsom and others insisted that the risk to the public remained low, but said the state is responding aggressively to the disease by tracking known contacts of infected individuals and working with federal officials to get testing kits and CDC experts on the ground.  “Everybody in this country is rightfully anxious about this moment,” Newsom said, “but I think they should know that we are meeting this moment with the right kind of urgency.”  Staff Writers Diana Lambert, Larry Gordon and Michael Burke contributed to this report.

       "'A woman with flu-like symptoms walked into a 50-bed Vacaville hospital and was treated for three days before her health deteriorated and she was transferred to UC Davis Medical Center in Sacramento — and five days after that, she tested positive for the new coronavirus.  New details emerged Thursday of the patient, a Solano County resident who is the first case of an individual in the U.S. for whom officials do not know the source of illness, raising the possibility that the virus is circulating in the community. The patient, who is not being identified, was diagnosed with COVID-19 on Wednesday.  Public health authorities are trying to trace all contacts the woman had after she became sick, but they are not saying where she lives, where she went in her community before she sought care, or who may be at risk of exposure.  Dozens of staff members at NorthBay VacaValley Hospital in Vacaville who had contact with her have been asked to stay home and monitor themselves for symptoms. Some may be placed under quarantine, said Dr. Bela Matyas, public health officer with Solano County Health and Social Services. The total number of possibly exposed health care workers was unknown but less than 100, officials said.  The woman’s family is under isolation, and her co-workers have been identified and their risk evaluated, Matyas said.  In addition, some workers at UC Davis Medical Center are isolating themselves at home.  The Solano County patient “was only potentially infectious for about a three-day window,” Matyas said at a news conference Thursday in Fairfield. “We can be very aggressive in identifying all the contacts in the community.”  He said that though the source of the woman’s infection is unknown, the risk to the general public remains “very, very low.”  While at VacaValley Hospital, the woman was intubated and put on a ventilator, a procedure that can put health care providers at-risk because droplets of respiratory fluid can become aerosolized and easier to breathe in. Steve Huddleston, vice president of public affairs with NorthBay Health Care, which oversees VacaValley Hospital, said the hospital stopped taking new patients for a few hours after the woman was diagnosed at UC Davis Medical Center, but reopened again Thursday morning and is operating as usual now.  The woman was transferred by ambulance to UC Davis Medical Center the morning of Feb. 19. Doctors there said they were concerned that the diagnosis of coronavirus was delayed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Doctors had asked her to be tested the day she arrived, but the CDC didn’t agree until four days later, on Feb. 23.  A UC Davis vice chancellor wrote in an internal email that the CDC did not initially agree to the testing because the woman did not meet its criteria, which include recent trips to China or contact with someone who has the disease.  The CDC changed those testing criteria Thursday to include people who have been hospitalized with a fever and severe respiratory illness like pneumonia, without an alternative diagnosis.  At a news conference in Sacramento Thursday, Gov. Gavin Newsom said California currently has about 200 testing kits — not enough to meet public health needs. But he said the CDC had promised to provide more in the next few days. He said the federal government may open testing sites in California so that the kits do not need to be sent back to the CDC headquarters in Atlanta for analysis.  “It’s simply inadequate to do justice to the kind of testing that is required to address this issue head-on,” Newsom said. “We have been assured of our capacity to significantly, exponentially increase the capacity to test.”  Newsom said the news Wednesday that the virus has possibly begun to spread into the community was not a surprise to state officials, given the large amount of travel between California and Asia. He said the state is monitoring more than 8,400 people who had arrived in California on flights from the region.  As of Thursday, 28 people in California besides the Solano County woman have tested positive for coronavirus. Eighteen of those people were passengers on the cruise ship Diamond Princess in Japan. They were quarantined at Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield, then moved to nearby hospitals. Nine other patients were infected while they were in China, where the coronavirus first appeared, and one person contracted the virus from her husband, who had traveled to China and was already sick.  The Solano County case is the first in the United States with no known source of infection. Travis Air Force Base is in Solano County, but state officials said there was no evidence the hospitalized county resident’s case was connected to the quarantine site.  Still, as local officials tried to allay concern about a connection between Travis and the patient, a whistle-blower said federal employees deployed to assist quarantined Americans at Travis and at March Air Force Base in Riverside were inadequately trained for infection control and had insufficient protective gear. A Washington Post report Thursday said some of those workers were allowed to leave the quarantined area and could have spread the coronavirus.  Matyas said that Solano County may not be the first place in the country to have community illness — it’s just the first place to report it. The virus could be spreading in other communities where public health officials haven’t been looking for it.  Because Solano and Sacramento counties have treated previous patients with coronavirus — including people who were quarantined at Travis — they “are just way more aware and attuned to it,” Matyas said. “There are probably community-acquired cases in other parts of the country now. They don’t know what to look for.”  He added that with the virus now presumably circulating in the county, the public health response shifts from “containment to mitigation”; in other words, from preventing the virus from entering the community altogether, to slowing down the spread of illness.  Newsom said California was prepared to handle the spreading virus because of its previous experience with recent epidemics like the Ebola virus, and there was “no better-resourced state in America to address this issue head-on.”  “We have history and expertise in this space,” he said.

       "'California Gov. Gavin Newsom said Thursday that 33 people have tested positive for COVID-19 and the state is currently monitoring at least 8,400 others —a day after U.S. health officials confirmed the first possible community transmission of the coronavirus in a Solano County resident. \"This is a fluid situation right now and I want to emphaize the risk to the American public remains low,\" said Dr. Sonia Y. Angell, California Department of Public Health Director and State Health Officer during a press conference. \"There have been a limited number of confirmed cases to date.\" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn\\'t know exactly how the new California patient, who\\'s receiving medical care in Sacramento County, contracted the virus. The patient didn\\'t have a relevant travel history or exposure to another patient with the virus, the CDC said Wednesday. California health officials said the patient wasn\\'t under quarantine before her diagnosis and was out and about in her community.

David Paul Morris | Bloomberg | Getty Images  \"We are currently in deep partnership with CDC on one overriding protocol that drives our principle focus right now and that\\'s testing, and the importance to increase our testing protocols and to have point of contact diagnostic testing as our top priority not just in the state of California but I imagine all across the United States,\" Newsom said at a press conference. Newsom said five of the 33 patients who tested positive for the virus have since left the state. It wasn\\'t immediately clear whether the 33 positive cases were part of the group of Diamond Princess passengers who were evacuated from the cruise ship that was quarantined off the coast of Japan. The U.S. had 60 cases as of Wednesday night, 42 of which are people who were on the ship, according to the CDC. California health officials have 200 testing kits on hand and will be receiving more over the next few days, Newsom said. \"We have just a few hundred testing kits and that\\'s surveillance testing as well as diagnostic testing. That\\'s simply inadequate to do justice to the kind of testing that is required to address this issue head on,\" he said. Newsom said that the CDC has made \"firm commitments\" to improve the state\\'s testing capacity, but did not provide details, such as how many testing kits the agency has agreed to send to the state.'"

       "\"Election Update  As we’ve mentioned, California really wants people to vote.  Didn’t register online in time for the deadline earlier this month? No problem; you can go in person on Election Day. Haven’t sent off your vote-by-mail ballot? Fine! (As long as it’s postmarked by Tuesday and gets to your county election office within three days.)  Secretary of State Alex Padilla told reporters on Thursday morning that more than 2.7 million Californians had already voted by mail. He wouldn't even estimate how many more ballots could be on their way (about 15 million vote-by-mail ballots went out), or how many people will take advantage of the in-person, day-of voter registration.  He did, however, caution that because of all the ways Californians can vote, it may take some time to finish verifying and counting all the ballots. County election officials must report final results to the secretary of state’s office by April 3.  So who’s going to win? That’s a tougher question to answer, but according to CalMatters, if things go according to the polls, Senator Bernie Sanders could win all the delegates chosen by statewide vote.  That’s not all of California’s delegates, but it’d still be a lot. (The CalMatters story also has a handy video to explain how California’s delegates are divvied up.)

       "'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is investigating what could be the first case of novel coronavirus in the United States involving a patient in California who neither recently traveled out of the country nor was in contact with someone who did.  “At this time, the patient’s exposure is unknown. It’s possible this could be an instance of community spread of COVID-19, which would be the first time this has happened in the United States,” the CDC said in a statement. “Community spread means spread of an illness for which the source of infection is unknown. It’s also possible, however, that the patient may have been exposed to a returned traveler who was infected.”  The individual is a resident of Solano County and is receiving medical care in Sacramento County, according to the state Department of Public Health.  Advertisement  The CDC said the “case was detected through the U.S. public health system — picked up by astute clinicians.”  Officials at UC Davis Medical Center expanded on what the federal agency might have meant by that in an email sent Wednesday, as first reported by the Davis Enterprise newspaper.  The patient arrived at UC Davis Medical Center from another hospital Feb. 19 and “had already been intubated, was on a ventilator, and given droplet protection orders because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition,” according to the email UC Davis officials.  Advertisement  The staff at UC Davis requested COVID-19 testing by the CDC, but because the patient didn’t fit the CDC’s existing criteria for the virus, a test wasn’t immediately administered, according to the email. The CDC then ordered the test Sunday, and results were announced Wednesday. Hospital administrators reportedly said in the email that despite these issues, there has been minimal exposure at the hospital because of safety protocols they have in place.  Since Feb. 2, more than 8,400 returning travelers from China have entered California, according to the state health department. They have been advised to self-quarantine for 14 days and limit interactions with others as much as possible, officials said.  “This is a new virus, and while we are still learning about it, there is a lot we already know,” Dr. Sonia Angell, director of the California Department of Public Health, said in a statement. “We have been anticipating the potential for such a case in the U.S., and given our close familial, social and business relationships with China, it is not unexpected that the first case in the U.S. would be in California.”  It is not clear how the person became infected, but public health workers could not identify any contacts with people who had traveled to China or other areas where the virus is widespread. That raises concern that the virus is spreading in the United States, creating a challenge for public health officials, experts say.  Advertisement  “It’s the first signal that we could be having silent transmission in the community,” said Lawrence Gostin, director of the World Health Organization Collaborating Center on National and Global Health Law. “It probably means there are many more cases out there, and it probably means this individual has infected others, and now it’s a race to try to find out who that person has infected.”  On Tuesday, the CDC offered its most serious warning to date that the United States should expect and prepare for the coronavirus to become a more widespread health issue.  “Ultimately, we expect we will see coronavirus spread in this country,” said Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases. “It’s not so much a question of if, but a question of when.”  Advertisement  According to the CDC’s latest count Wednesday morning, 59 U.S. residents have tested positive for the new strain of coronavirus — 42 of whom are repatriated citizens from a Diamond Princess cruise. That number has grown by two since Messonnier’s last count Tuesday, although the CDC was not immediately available to offer details on the additional cases.  More than 82,000 cases of coronavirus have been reported globally, and more than 2,700 people have died, with the majority in mainland China, the epicenter of the outbreak.  But public health leaders have repeatedly reminded residents that the health risk from the novel coronavirus to the general public remains low.  “While COVID-19 has a high transmission rate, it has a low mortality rate,” the state Department of Public Health said in a statement Wednesday. “From the international data we have, of those who have tested positive for COVID-19, approximately 80% do not exhibit symptoms that would require hospitalization. There have been no confirmed deaths related to COVID-19 in the United States to date.”  Advertisement  CDC officials have also warned that although the virus is likely to spread in U.S. communities, the flu still poses a greater risk.  Gostin said the news of potential silent transmission does not eliminate the possibility of containing the virus in the U.S. and preventing an outbreak.  “There are few enough cases that we should at least try,” he said. “Most of us are not optimistic that that will be successful, but we’re still in the position to try.”'"

       "'A new case of novel coronavirus in Northern California is suspected to be the first known incident of person-to-person transmission in the general public in United States, officials said Wednesday.  A new case of novel coronavirus in Northern California is suspected to be the first known incident of person-to-person transmission in the general public in United States, officials said Wednesday. Kris Sanchez reports.  California officials said the person is a resident of Solano County, northeast of San Francisco, and is getting medical care in Sacramento County. They said they have begun the process of tracking down people who the patient has been in contact with, a process known as contact tracing.  In what may be the United States\\' first coronavirus case of transmission through person-to-person transmission in the general public, a resident of Solano County is being treated for the novel virus at UC Davis Medical Center, officials said. Cheryl Hurd reports.  The patient was brought to UC Davis Medical Center from another Northern California hospital on Feb. 19 but it was four days before the CDC heeded a request to test the patient for COVID-19, according to an email sent to employees Wednesday by the hospital’s interim CEO, Brad Simmons, and David Lubarsky, CEO of UC Davis Health.  The patient arrived on a ventilator and special protection orders were issued \"because of an undiagnosed and suspected viral condition,\" according to the email, which was sent to employees.  The hospital asked the CDC to test for the coronavirus but testing was delayed until Sunday \"since the patient did not fit the existing CDC criteria for COVID-19,\" the email said.  The hospital, which has treated other coronavirus patients, has been taking infection prevention precautions since the patient arrived. The email said officials believe there was only a small chance that others at the facility were exposed to the virus.  \"Nevertheless, a small number of medical center employees have been asked to stay home and monitor their temperatures,\" the email said.  Messages to the CDC seeking comment on the email were not immediately returned Wednesday night.  All of the 59 other cases in the U.S. had traveled from abroad or had been in close contact with those who traveled. Health officials have been on high alert for so-called community spread.  Earlier U.S. cases included 14 in people who traveled back from outbreak areas in China, or their spouses; three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship who were evacuated by the federal government to the U.S. from where the ship was docked in Japan.  Some of those evacuated were taken to Travis Air Force Base, which is in Solano County. A number of the earlier cases have been in California, including among some of the people taken to Travis and one in which a traveler who returned to San Benito County spread it to a spouse.  California officials have been preparing for the possibility that community spread of the virus might first surface there.  \"We have been anticipating the potential for such a case in the U.S., and given our close familial, social and business relationships with China, it is not unexpected that the first case in the U.S. would be in California,\" said Dr. Sonia Angell, Director of the California Department of Public Health and State Public Health Officer, in a statement.  The outbreak, which began in China, has infected tends of thousands of people in more than three dozen countries, with the vast majority in mainland China.  The new virus is a member of the coronavirus family that can cause colds or more serious illnesses such as SARS and MERS.  The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.  Officials are advising people to take steps to avoid infection with coronavirus or other respiratory infections like a cold or the flu, including washing hands with soap and water and avoiding close contact with people who are sick.'"

       "'We\\'ve been tracking the number of coronavirus cases, how some people are reacting with fear and bigotry, and how public agencies and officials are preparing for the possibility of an outbreak here of COVID-19, as the disease is being called.  KPCC’s Take Two explored another important aspect of this public health issue that many of us don’t use to our benefit but may end up needing – paid sick leave, and whether Californians even have access to it.  Labor sociologist Ruth Milkman from City University of New York said a study of hers found less than half of adult workers in California knew about their rights to paid family leave (the kind where workers can take extended leave to welcome a new baby or care for an ailing parent).  \"There’s an old joke among people who advocate for paid sick leave: ‘Would you like some flu with those fries?’”  Milkman was speaking specifically about people in food service who might not have been eligible for paid sick time off. Starting in 2015, however, California required all employers to offer a minimum of three sick days each year to workers, even those who are part-time in places like restaurants or grocery stores.  At minimum, workers earn one hour of sick leave for every 30 hours worked. When they take advantage of sick leave, it can reduce transmissions between coworkers, or between employees and clients. But fear may push some to come to work, anyway.  “Will they get a promotion, or will a manager look at them favorably?” said Milkman. “But if you’re sick in the workplace, you can infect other people. So it’s actually an altruistic act to take a wellness day.”  She said change needs to come from the top:  “Employers have some moral obligations. A supervisor or a manager is in a position to say [to stay home] in a way that reassures people that there is no consequence for doing that, so those are the people who really should be trained to do this.”  LEARN MORE ABOUT COVID-19:'"

       "'The nation\\'s second case of unexplained coronavirus - in which a person emerges with the infection with no obvious indication of how the virus was transmitted - has been reported in California, health officials confirmed Friday.  Officials in San Jose said the patient was an older adult woman with chronic health conditions who does not have a travel history or any known contact with a traveler or infected person. It comes two days after state officials said a woman in Solano County had contracted the illness after no known contact.  “This new case indicates that there is evidence of community transmission but the extent is still not clear,” said Dr. Sara Cody, Health Officer for Santa Clara County and Director of the County of Santa Clara Public Health Department. \"This case does signal to us that it\\'s now time to shift how we respond to the novel coronavirus.\"  While existing prevention measures like reaching out to contacts of infected patients has worked, Cody said agencies \"need to add other public health tools.\"  \"What we know now is that the virus is here, present at some level, but we still don\\'t know to what degree,\" Cody said.  The new infection in Santa Clara County brings another troubling chapter to the coronavirus grip on health fears throughout the U.S. and other countries.  The latest case, involving a woman in her 60s, marks an escalation of the worldwide outbreak in the U.S. because it means the virus could spread beyond the reach of preventative measures like quarantines. However, state health officials say that the risk of widespread transmission remains low.  Solano County Public Health Officer Dr. Bela Matyas said officials have identified dozens of people – but less than 100 – who had close contact with the infected woman. They are quarantined in their homes and a few who have shown symptoms are in isolation, Matyas said.  Besides the women from Santa Clara and Solano counties, the 60 other people in the U.S. with COVID-19 have either traveled abroad or had close contact with others who traveled. Seven of those U.S. patients have since fully recovered from the virus.  Oregon officials announced Friday that the state has identified its first presumed case of the virus. Oregon Health Authority Director Patrick Allen declined to identify the infected patient, but said there was no known travel exposure.  Earlier U.S. cases included 14 in people who returned from outbreak areas in China, or their spouses; three people who were evacuated from the central China city of Wuhan; and 42 American passengers on the Diamond Princess cruise ship.  The global count of those sickened by the virus stood at 85,176 on Friday. The death count stands at 2,919, most of them in China.  Meanwhile, officials from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shed some more light on the virus at Friday\\'s press conference in California, including how long it can survive on surfaces.  A CDC official at the press conference said the virus can live for days on surfaces, but the good news is that the virus can also be killed easily with cleaning products. What\\'s more, officials don\\'t believe people are usually infected by touching long-contaminated surfaces in the first place.  The virus can cause fever, coughing, wheezing and pneumonia. Health officials think it spreads mainly from droplets when an infected person coughs or sneezes, similar to how the flu spreads.  The news is causing residents in communities near the latest infections to take extra precautions.  “I’m definitely going to wear my mask and gloves at work, because I’m a server,” said Vacaville, California bowling alley worker Denise Arriaga, who said she doesn’t care if she’s criticized for the extra precautions.  “At the end of the day, it’s my life,” she said.

       "'A second case of new coronavirus has been identified in San Diego among evacuees from China, bringing the total number to eight in California and 15 in the United States.  The person was aboard a flight from the city of Wuhan that arrived at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in Southern California last week, the CDC said.  The patient was in isolation at a San Diego hospital, UC San Diego Health confirmed.  Also in isolation is a woman who was mistakenly released because of a mislabeled sample that hadn\\'t been tested for coronavirus. She was returned to the hospital on Monday after testing positive for the virus.  Originating in Wuhan, the new coronavirus has infected more than 60,000 people and killed more than 1,300 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The majority of cases are in China, but the virus has spread to at least 25 other countries. Two deaths have been recorded outside mainland China, one in Hong Kong and one in the Philippines.  In the U.S. 15 cases have been identified: eight in California, two in Illinois and one each in Arizona, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin.  In California, Santa Clara, San Benito and now San Diego counties have seen two cases each, and there is one each in Los Angeles and Orange counties.

A third person whose test results are pending also is hospitalized in isolation.  “We want to reassure our patients, their loved ones and the community at large that there is no exposure risk at any UC San Diego Health hospitals or clinics,\" the health system said in a statement.  Hundreds of people, including U.S. State Department employees and their families, have arrived at military bases in California, Texas and Nebraska aboard chartered flights from Wuhan, a city of 11 million that is the epicenter for the virus.  Recent chartered flights have sent hundreds of Wuhan evacuees back to the U.S. They are being held in quarantine at military bases in California, Texas and Nebraska.  A plane carrying 178 American coronavirus evacuees from Wuhan landed early Wednesday at Travis Air Force Base, 50 miles northeast of San Francisco. All evacuees will be quarantined for 14 days and staying in isolation at the Westwind Inn on Travis AFB. They won\\'t have any contact with people living and working on the base. Five of the evacuees taken to Travis Air Force Base were hospitalized after showing symptoms of the virus and on Wednesday they were confirmed to not have the virus.

       "'Board games for children? Definitely. Tai chi in the parking lot? Maybe. Red wine dropped off by relatives? Nope.  For the hundreds of Americans who have been evacuated from China amid the coronavirus outbreak, the stress and worries of possible infection and getting back to the United States have been joined by another pressing concern: How do you fill two unexpected weeks quarantined on a military base?  To be sure, there are frequent medical checks for symptoms of the illness. But for the rest of the time, officials are navigating how to make evacuees feel at home on the bases, three of which are in California, while also protecting them and others from potential infection.  The quarantine orders are the first in 50 years issued by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Officials say they are necessary to prevent the global spread of a virus that has already infected 28,000 people worldwide.  Advertisement  John McGory touched down at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego along with 166 other passengers Wednesday. The journey from Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak and where McGory had lived for the last six years, was filled with detours and stops and took 37 hours, he said.  McGory, 65, was put up in an apartment in the base’s bachelors quarters, which had been emptied for the arriving passengers. Staff regularly drop off meals at his door and also take his temperature to check for a fever.  McGory said officials laid out ground rules in a welcome meeting Wednesday. Face masks are not required, and people who work and live on the base have been told not to interact with the passengers.  Officials told McGory’s group that they would set up a message board for people to throw out ideas for group activities. Someone suggested a tai chi class, McGory said. Officials said they would bring board and card games.  Advertisement  McGory said he wants to ride out the quarantine by writing about his experiences and by teaching a storytelling class where perhaps people can share tales of Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital.  “It can’t be worse than the last two weeks,” McGory said.  McGory’s flight was one of several recently arranged by U.S. officials for U.S. citizens and their families to escape China during the outbreak. Three other bases outside California have also been designated as quarantine sites.

(John McGory)  Advertisement  The coronavirus outbreak that began late last year in Wuhan has spread to four continents and killed 565 people as of Wednesday. The U.S. has advised Americans not to fly to China and is temporarily barring foreign nationals who have recently visited China from entering the country.  Passengers were not allowed to board flights to the U.S. if they showed symptoms of illness, according to CDC officials. They were checked for fevers while on the planes and as soon as their landed.  After touchdown in Miramar on Wednesday, four passengers from McGory’s flight were taken to local hospitals after showing symptoms of coronavirus infection.  In a news conference Wednesday, Dr. Christopher Braden, a deputy director with the CDC, acknowledged that others on the base and in the greater San Diego area may be concerned about the evacuees living there for two weeks. He said people on the base had expressed concern that their children who live there may get sick or not be allowed to attend school.  Advertisement  But the new virus spreads through close contact, similar to the flu, Braden said. This coronavirus also seems to require more prolonged contact to be transmitted to another person, he said. He said that those quarantined would be continually checked for symptoms.  “They’ve had a very difficult experience, and we’re doing everything possible to care for them,” he said. “We are in a critical time period in the international spread of the virus, and this action is necessary try to prevent the spread here in the U.S.”  McGory moved to Wuhan six years ago to teach English at a university there. He had planned to move back to the U.S. this month, but those plans were upended by the coronavirus outbreak.  Since late January, he had been mostly confined to his apartment on the university campus. He tried to talk on the phone and message with people throughout the day to stave off boredom, he said.  Advertisement  As the quarantine continued into February, people began to panic, he said. Over a beer, a friend told him she didn’t think she would survive the illness if she got it because of her weak lungs. Grocery stores were running low on food. The city, which has a population of 11 million, was mostly deserted, he said.  McGory had planned to pack up his belongings and ship some of them to Ohio, where he is from and plans to resettle. But in a rush to catch one of the flights back to the U.S. this week, he decided to leave behind most of his clothes, he said. He was allowed to take only 70 pounds of luggage on the flight.  It hurt to leave behind his friends and co-workers, especially in the midst of an outbreak, he said. A goodbye hug with a friend made him breakdown in tears, he said.  “It makes me sad that after six years in Wuhan I have to leave it this way,” he said.  Advertisement  McGory said his flight to the U.S. had at least 50 children onboard. The plane made a seven-hour stop at Travis Air Force Base outside Vacaville, Calif., before arriving in San Diego. The detour was to drop off people reuniting with their families, officials said.  When the plane arrived in San Diego, the 14-day countdown clock started ticking. Once two weeks are up, those quarantined should be released, officials said. If someone falls ill while on the base, their close contacts may need to spend additional days in quarantine until they are cleared, officials said.  “I hope I stay healthy. That’s everyone’s concern here first,” McGory said.  Braden said that while living at Miramar, the evacuees will receive three meals a day as well as snacks. They are able to spend time with each other as well as explore the two buildings and the surrounding area that is included in the quarantine, he said.  Advertisement  One of the quarantine areas has a playground, and the other will soon get one. Officials are also assessing what other needs families might have, such as playing cards or a basketball court, said Caroline Thorman, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ Administration for Children and Families.  “We are helping facilities with all the needs … all of the recreational activities that these families might need so they can have a pleasant and welcome stay at the base,” Thorman said at the news conference Wednesday.  McGory has two sisters who live a 10-minute drive from the base. He inquired to see if one of them could bring him a bottle of red wine. Staff said no.  The breakfast that John McGory, an American evacuated from China amid the coronavirus outbreak, was served Thursday. (John McGory)  Advertisement  McGory said he is trying to stay optimistic. When he reconnected to the internet Wednesday, he saw that while he was in transit, his grandson was born — Arthur, his fourth grandchild.  During the initial meeting at Miramar after the group deplaned, as they reviewed coronavirus symptoms and quarantine instructions, McGory decided to share some positive news with the group.  “I told them about my grandson,” he said, “and everyone applauded.”'"

       "'(Reuters) - The 13th case of coronavirus in the United States was detected in California in a person under federal quarantine after returning from Wuhan, China, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said on Monday.  The adult patient was among U.S. nationals evacuated from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease, who were under mandatory quarantine for 14 days at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, near San Diego, the CDC said in a statement.  The individual was taken to the University of California San Diego Medical Center for observation and isolation and is “doing well,” the hospital said in a statement.  “CDC is conducting a thorough contact investigation of the person who has tested positive to determine contacts and to assess if those contacts had high risk exposures,” the CDC said.  Some 800 U.S. nationals have been evacuated from Wuhan and flown to air bases in the United States where they are subject to the CDC’s first public health quarantine in 50 years.  The U.S. has imposed mandatory quarantines and travel restrictions with China to slow the spread of coronavirus within the United States. U.S. officials fear a global pandemic if the virus is allowed to gain a foothold outside China, where the death toll has climbed to more than 1,000.  The latest individual diagnosed with coronavirus was the first confirmed case among some 800 U.S. nationals evacuated to military bases in the United States on flights from Wuhan, the epicenter of the disease.  The person was among four evacuees taken to the UC San Diego Medical Center for further evaluation last week after arriving at the Miramar air base.  On Sunday the CDC said all four patients initially tested negative for the virus and were discharged and returned to quarantine at the base. Further testing showed one of the four was positive and the patient was returned to the hospital.  Another patient from MCAS Miramar was taken to the hospital on Monday for evaluation, the medical center said.  “Both patients are doing well and have minimal symptoms,” the hospital said.  None of the coronavirus cases confirmed in the United States has proved fatal and several patients have been released from hospital.  With most U.S.-China flights suspended, only a handful of U.S. nationals arriving on commercial flights have been quarantined under rules imposed on Feb. 2 to curb the virus’s spread, according to a Reuters survey.  Of eight states with airports screening travelers for the virus, six said they had no one under quarantine, New York reported four people and Illinois a “tiny” number, the survey found.'"

       "'Coronavirus Update: 346 Americans Emerge From Quarantine At California Military Bases  Enlarge this image toggle caption Philip and Gay Courter/via Reuters Philip and Gay Courter/via Reuters  Updated at 2:24 p.m. ET  Some 346 Americans who were evacuated from Wuhan, China, amid the deadly coronavirus outbreak emerged from their quarantine at two military bases in California on Tuesday, U.S. officials say.  The group includes 180 Americans who have been living under a mandatory quarantine order at Travis Air Force Base, roughly 40 miles southwest of Sacramento, and 166 U.S. citizens who have been living at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar near San Diego.  \"One person from the MCAS Miramar group who is confirmed to have COVID-19 remains under care at a local hospital,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said in a statement sent to NPR.  All of the other U.S. evacuees \"have been medically cleared and CDC officials have lifted their quarantine orders,\" said Jason McDonald, a CDC press officer.  The evacuees left China on planes chartered by the State Department in early February, as the city of Wuhan, center of the novel coronavirus outbreak, was placed under a near-total lockdown. Their 14-day mandatory quarantine is now over.  \"It is important to know that these people being released from quarantine pose no health risk to the surrounding community, or to the communities they will be returning to,\" McDonald said.  He added that all the remaining Americans who took U.S.-chartered flights out of Wuhan are expected to complete their own quarantine periods later this week.  \"Newly quarantined Diamond Princess cruise ship passengers are being kept separate from those individuals who are already at Travis and nearing the end of their quarantine,\" McDonald said, referring to the ship that\\'s been sitting at a cruise ship terminal under a quarantine in Yokohama, Japan.  Tuesday\\'s release of Americans from quarantine comes one week after a flightload of 195 Americans was freed from quarantine orders at the March Air Reserve Base in Southern California.  Quarantined cruise ship to get meals from José Andrés\\' charity  World Central Kitchen, initially created by chef José Andrés to help people stricken by natural disasters in the Caribbean, says it has set up a field kitchen in a parking lot near the Diamond Princess cruise ship at Shinko Pier in Yokohama, Japan, where the vessel is nearing the end of a 14-day coronavirus quarantine.  The charity is providing food for those on board in a bid to ease the strain on the ship\\'s crew, which has been working to feed passengers, keep the ship clean and perform other duties as the cruise ship sits in isolation at the terminal.  The Diamond Princess\\' captain announced World Central Kitchen\\'s new role in a shipwide address Tuesday, according to passenger Matthew Smith.  \"This is to relieve pressure on the crew,\" Smith said via Twitter, adding that he believes the extra help could make it easier for people working on the ship to observe quarantine rules.  \"It\\'s definitely a different situation for us,\" World Central Kitchen\\'s Sam Bloch said in a video update about the operation, acknowledging the uncertainty over how long the quarantine might last for some passengers and crew.  The food is prepared and cooked in a full kitchen before it\\'s taken to an impromptu kitchen at the terminal, the group says. From there, it gets reheated as needed and delivered to the ship. Bloch, who directs the group\\'s field operations, says the meals are ready to serve when their containers are loaded onto the ship by forklift.  \"The crew doesn\\'t have to cook and do all the work,\" Bloch says. \"They get to get some rest.\"  Andrés said via Twitter that the World Central Kitchen team \"will be there working side by side with everyone on the ground as long as we are needed.\"  Before arriving in Japan, Bloch was working in Australia, where World Central Kitchen operates a \"relief kitchen\" to feed firefighters and evacuees. The organization is active in a number of other places, from Puerto Rico and the Bahamas to Venezuela and along the U.S.-Mexico border.  Hospital director in Wuhan dies of COVID-19  The director of a hospital in Wuhan, China, the center of a deadly coronavirus outbreak, has died from the disease COVID-19, state media reported Tuesday, highlighting the risk that the respiratory virus poses to health professionals.  Liu Zhiming, whose age is variously being reported as 50 or 51, was head of the Wuchang Hospital. He was also one of more than 1,700 medical workers confirmed to be infected with the highly contagious virus, according to China Daily. The state news outlet adds that the number of workers dates from last Tuesday — meaning even more doctors, nurses and other medical staff might now be infected.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images Greg Baker/AFP via Getty Images  Outbreak\\'s pace is seen slowing in China  Mainland China currently has seen more than 70,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases, according to the World Health Organization. And while the country has suffered the majority of deaths associated with the outbreak, health experts in China say there are signs that the pace at which the virus is spreading might be slowing down.  As NPR\\'s Emily Feng reports from Beijing:  \"Today\\'s numbers from China\\'s national health commission show that the rate at which new cases reported outside Hubei province, where the epidemic has been concentrated, has dropped for two weeks. China\\'s top state epidemiologist said earlier this week that he expected the outbreak to peak sometime in April. \"However, distrust in official state statistics is still high. Hubei in part has the largest share of virus cases in China because it is the only province that discloses so called clinical cases — symptomatic patients who haven\\'t tested positive for the virus. Other provinces are mandated to collect such data but have not disclosed these types of cases publicly.\"  88 more cases on Diamond Princess cruise ship  The Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined at a terminal in Yokohama, Japan, still represents the largest cluster of COVID-19 cases outside China. On Tuesday, Japan\\'s health ministry said tests confirmed 88 more cases — including 65 people who were identified as asymptomatic pathogen carriers. The diagnoses bring the total number of cases from the ship to 542 out of 2,404 people who have been tested, Japanese officials say.  The Diamond Princess had some 3,700 people aboard when it docked in the port south of Tokyo earlier this month. But hundreds of people have since disembarked, either to receive care at local hospitals or, in the case of more than 300 American passengers, to fly back to the U.S. on chartered evacuation flights.  \"We walked into the airplane hangar, and there were military people clapping and cheering for us,\" former Diamond Princess passenger Gay Courter told NPR\\'s Morning Edition, describing the scene as she and her husband, Philip, arrived at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas. \"And that\\'s when I broke down in tears. It was this overwhelming relief.\"  Sixty-one U.S. citizens remain on the Diamond Princess, which is slated to begin emerging from its blanket quarantine on Wednesday. While many passengers will be allowed to leave the ship if they test negative for the new coronavirus, others will have to undergo a longer quarantine if they\\'ve been in close contact with anyone who has the COVID-19 disease.  Infected U.S. evacuees taken to Omaha, Neb.  After the U.S. passengers were taken off the Diamond Princess, 14 of them were revealed to have tested positive for the new coronavirus. U.S. officials say they got the results after the patients had been taken off the ship — and that all 14 were placed in a special section at the rear of one of the chartered jets because of the possible health risk to other evacuees.  The evacuees were flown to Lackland in Texas and Travis Air Force Base in California — the two designated quarantine spots for Diamond Princess passengers taken to the U.S. But 13 infected evacuees were then flown to Omaha, Neb., to receive care at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. It\\'s not clear why the other infected evacuee wasn\\'t among them.  \"Those who have tested positive for this novel coronavirus, are only showing mild symptoms of the disease,\" Nebraska Medicine said in a statement.  The facility includes a 20-bed national quarantine unit, where 12 of the evacuees are now being monitored. But another evacuee was deemed to need specialized care and was placed in a biocontainment unit.  The University of Nebraska Medical Center runs the national Training, Simulation and Quarantine Center, which it says has \"the nation\\'s only federal quarantine unit and simulated biocontainment units for advanced experiential training.\"  The center has been involved in combating other dangerous outbreaks in recent years, including the Ebola virus outbreak that started in 2014.'"

       "'California health officials will soon be able to test for coronavirus at 16 labs across the state.  Until now, all coronavirus testing was being conducted by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Federal officials issued an emergency authorization this week allowing some state labs to perform the tests, including several in California.  The California Department of Public Health says it will be able to test specimens in just two days, compared to the two to seven days it takes at the CDC. They expect to have the testing up and running by Feb. 12.  Tracey Goldstein, a professor of pathology, immunology and microbiology at UC Davis, says speedier lab work can help prevent disease spread.  “If there is a case that comes over, getting results quicker helps to do the contact tracing and to make sure that no additional cases occur through that contact with that one sick person,” Goldstein said.  There have been 12 confirmed coronavirus cases in the U.S. so far, including six in California. The virus has killed more than 600 people in China and sickened thousands more.  The federal government is identifying people coming back from certain areas of China where disease risk is high, and quarantining and testing those travelers before allowing them to return to the U.S. There are currently quarantined travelers at two U.S.military bases: Travis Air Force Base in Fairfield and Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.  Federal and state health officials are emphasizing that the risk of catching coronavirus in the U.S. is low. They’re encouraging everyone to wash their hands, avoid sick individuals and stay home when ill as a means of preventing other infectious diseases, including influenza.'"

       "'After a patient who tested positive was mistakenly released from isolation at the San Diego military base, residents want more testing  Coronavirus evacuees being held in a southern California quarantine have released a petition of demands calling for better oversight in the center where they are staying, after an infected patient was mistakenly released from isolation and back into the general quarantine population.  Hundreds of American evacuees from China have been flown to military bases in Texas, California and Nebraska for a minimum quarantine of two weeks. That includes about 200 people who are currently in the state-mandated quarantine at Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego.  The quarantines come as the coronavirus epidemic continues to spread, infecting more than 43,000 people worldwide and killing more than 1,100 people in China so far.  UK prepares for more coronavirus cases after first London diagnosis Read more  A female patient at the military base who had tested positive for coronavirus was mistakenly released from isolation into the general quarantine population, causing panic among the other residents, one patient told the Guardian.  “It’s kind of out of control right now,” said Blair Zong, a 33-year-old project coordinator from San Jose. “It has created a huge conflict internally how this woman with a diagnosis has been handled.”  Zong was quarantined on her way back to California from Wuhan, China, where she was visiting family. She has been on lockdown since 8 February and will remain there until 21 February.  Residents of the quarantine have a daily schedule that includes three meals, two temperature checks per day, and a “town hall” meeting in the afternoons where staff informs them of any recent updates, Zong says. She spends her days writing in her journal, watching TV, and exercising outdoors inside the military base.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A selection of food available in quarantine on a military base in San Diego, California. Photograph: Courtesy of Blair Zong  “I feel totally fine,” she said. “The CDC staff is working hard to take care of everyone and it’s getting better every day.”  In the petition released on Wednesday, members of the quarantined population issued demands to: test everyone in the facility for coronavirus whether or not they are showing symptoms; prevent gatherings of large numbers of people in common areas; deliver protective gear to rooms where people are staying; provide hand sanitizer in public spaces including the facility’s playground; and clean common areas more often.  The CDC previously said in a statement that the premature release of the infected patient was due to confusion caused by using pseudonyms for patients under evaluation for privacy purposes. There are no issues with the testing process itself.  A spokesman told the Guardian the CDC plans to implement as many of the demands from the evacuees as possible. “We continue to do everything we can to care for and provide for the evacuees here at Miramar,” he said.  The infected woman in question took a van ride with three other patients, all of whom were wearing breathing masks, from the hospital back to the military base. The patient is not believed to be highly contagious and only has a cough, according to officials. Her infection marks the 13th known case of the virus in the United States.  The details about the mix-up were released the same day 195 evacuees were cleared to leave March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California, after clearing their final screening. None of those evacuees tested positive.  Meanwhile, Zong said, patients at the base are complying with government mandated rules by testing their temperatures twice a day to monitor for fever. She said she did not agree with the petition and that she feels relatively safe in the quarantine.  “It’s actually been very peaceful here my first few days”, she said. “People keep complaining about the food, but it is quarantine, not vacation.”  Agencies contributed reporting.'"

       "'U.S. officials said early Monday that 14 American passengers evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship in Japan had tested positive for the new coronavirus, but were allowed on flights to military bases in California and Texas.  The State Department chartered the flights to transport more than 300 U.S. citizens from the ship, which had been docked off Yokohama since Feb. 3. The passengers landed Monday at Travis Air Force Base in Solano County, although some will continue on to Joint Base San Antonio-Lackland. All will face a 14-day quarantine on the bases.  The 14 infected passengers had been tested two to three days before the evacuation but officials received notice of the positive results after they had left the ship for the airport, the U.S. Departments of State and Health and Human Services said in a joint statement.  The passengers did not display symptoms, the statement added. They were isolated in a specialized containment area on the aircraft. All passengers were to be closely monitored by medical personnel during the flights and moved to the containment area if they showed symptoms, officials said.  Advertisement  Those who stay at Travis Air Force Base will be housed separately from the 234 people already quarantined there after arriving on previous evacuation flights that landed Feb. 5 and Feb. 7, officials said.  The Diamond Princess set sail Jan. 20 and was placed under quarantine by Japanese officials on Feb. 5 after a passenger who departed the cruise ship in Hong Kong tested positive for the coronavirus.  “We understand this is frustrating and an adjustment, but these measures are consistent with the careful policies we have instituted to limit the potential spread of the disease,” the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo said in a letter sent to cruise ship passengers Saturday.  Advertisement  So far, no positive coronavirus results have been reported among those quarantined earlier at Travis; one case has been reported among those quarantined at Lackland. The virus has killed more than 1,800 people and infected more than 73,000 since it was discovered in Wuhan, China, in late December.  Travis is one of three military bases in California that the Defense Department has designated as a site to house returning coronavirus evacuees. The others are Marine Corps Air Station Miramar in San Diego County, where 232 people are currently quarantined, and March Air Reserve Base in Riverside County. About 195 people were permitted to leave from there on Tuesday after completing a 14-day quarantine.  The move to transport the American cruise ship passengers came as the number of coronavirus cases aboard the Diamond Princess continued to grow over the weekend, with 67 new diagnoses on Saturday, and the U.S. government issued a recommendation that all American passengers and crew members leave.  Advertisement  “We are deeply grateful to the cruise line and government of Japan for working diligently to contain and control the spread of the illness,” the letter from the U.S. Embassy said. “However, to fulfill our government’s responsibilities to U.S. citizens under our rules and practices, as well as to reduce the burden on the Japanese healthcare system, the U.S. government recommends, out of an abundance of caution, that U.S. citizens disembark and return to the United States for further monitoring.”  The 3,700 passengers and crew members aboard the Diamond Princess include two Santa Clarita residents, Carl Goldman and his wife, Jeri Seratti Goldman. The couple own the radio station KHTS and have been documenting their experiences in a diary on the station’s website.  Many of the posts have been lighthearted, but on Saturday, Carl Goldman wrote that one of their traveling companions had been diagnosed with the COVID-19 virus.  “It’s a sad day aboard the Diamond Princess,” he wrote. “No joking today.”  Advertisement  The woman, Jerri Jorgenson, and her husband, Mark, were confined to the cabin adjoining the Goldmans’, and the two couples had unlocked a partition separating their balconies so they could move freely back and forth between the units during the quarantine, Carl Goldman wrote.  “Last night, after watching a movie, all four of us took our temperatures. Jerri had a fever,” he wrote. “In the morning, she still had a fever. As Mark and Jerri were getting ready to call the ship’s hospital, Japanese health officials knocked on their door. They were dressed in hazmat suits.”  He said that they handed Mark Jorgenson a letter saying that his wife had tested positive for the virus and said she had one hour to pack a small bag. She was taken by ambulance to a hospital about four hours away in Fukushima, where her husband was not permitted to join her, Goldman wrote.  Advertisement  Goldman, his wife and Mark Jorgenson were planning to fly back to the U.S. on one of the evacuation flights and undergo a second quarantine at one of the military bases, Goldman wrote.  “We are unclear what tomorrow will bring,” he wrote. “We are shaken and devastated that we have been removed from our friend.”  Health officials say that the COVID-19 virus continues to pose a low risk to the general American public. Just 15 cases had been diagnosed in the U.S.: eight in California, two in Illinois, and one each in Arizona, Massachusetts, Texas, Washington and Wisconsin. All of the patients had either recently traveled to mainland China or, in two cases, had close contact with someone who did. At least three of the cases were among people who had recently arrived on an evacuation flight from Wuhan.'"

       "'[Update: The governor criticized the C.D.C. over delays in testing.]  ALBANY, N.Y. — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo declared a state of emergency on Saturday as the number of coronavirus cases in New York rose to 89, which include a Queens driver who worked for Uber and two unexplained positive tests of patients 200 miles to the north.  Moving on multiple fronts to curb the spread of the virus, Mr. Cuomo said the state of emergency would allow New York’s government to respond faster by lifting regulations.  The governor’s announcement came as concerns about the outbreak grew in New York City, which has 12 confirmed cases, up from six that were disclosed as of Friday. The epicenter in New York State continues to be just north of the city, in Westchester County, where there are 70 cases in total.  These cases were mostly, if not all, related to a cluster in Westchester that first came to the authorities’ attention after a New Rochelle resident, a 50-year-old lawyer, was confirmed as New York’s second coronavirus patient.'"

       "'Mr. Corbett said New Jersey Transit had experienced a “dramatic 88 percent reduction in systemwide ridership” since March 9. He said revenue had fallen in line with ridership and that the agency expected “this precipitous drop to continue” as fewer riders to buy monthly passes.  New Jersey Transit’s schedule changes apply only to the agency’s trains and affect all lines except for the Atlantic City Rail Line, and do not affect buses or light-rail systems.  On weekdays, eight daily runs will be added to the usual weekend schedule on the Morris and Essex line between Dover and Hoboken. Service on the Gladstone branch will be unchanged.  Three more correction officers test positive, officials say.  The city’s Department of Correction confirmed on Thursday that two correction officers and a captain had tested positive for the coronavirus.  The announcement came a day after an inmate, a man in his 30s, at the Rikers Island jail complex tested positive, as did a correction officer who was assigned to a security checkpoint there. Eight other inmates who were in contact with the man and had shown symptoms of the virus have been placed in isolation at a Rikers hospital unit.  The mayor’s office is trying to identify Rikers inmates who could be released early in hopes of stemming the virus’s spread among the roughly 5,400 people in the city’s custody. Mr. de Blasio said on Wednesday that inmates with underlying health conditions could be eligible.  On Thursday, the mayor said that the city had identified 40 inmates who could be released, pending the approval of other criminal justice authorities.'"

       "'There are now 3,954 confirmed cases of the new coronavirus, and 26 deaths, in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Thursday night.  Borough breakdown, with some fluctuation in the numbers, as of 8:30 p.m. Thursday:  Brooklyn: 1,195 cases  Queens: 1,042  Manhattan: 1,038  Bronx: 496  Staten Island: 179  The city in the afternoon said 554 people had been hospitalized, with 169 of those patients in the ICU.  The confirmed case total in New York City has just about doubled in each of the past two days — it was 1,871 on Wednesday evening and 923 on Tuesday night.  In the morning, Gov. Andrew Cuomo reported 4,152 confirmed cases statewide, although the city’s own reported total has increased by 1,485 since then. As of the morning, 777 patients were hospitalized statewide, a 19 percent hospitalization rate.  The increases in confirmed cases have soared in the past week. On March 11, there were 216 cases in New York state in total. A week before that: just 11.  The details of the cases are not confirmed, but de Blasio said Sunday that all the people in the city who died — five at that point — had pre-existing conditions. The elderly and those with pre-existing conditions are those most at risk.  The numbers of cases are expected to only increase exponentially — the mayor himself predicted the city would reach 10,000 cases soon — over the coming weeks and months as more tests are conducted. At a press briefing Saturday, New York City Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot said the city\\'s \"best estimate\" for the end of the coronavirus crisis at this time was \"some time in September.\"  De Blasio is also demanding the federal government mobilize the military to help in the response efforts, and stressed the city does not have enough medical supplies to last past March as cases balloon.

       "'There are 463 confirmed cases of coronavirus in New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced at a news briefing in the Blue Room of City Hall Monday afternoon.  So far, the city has recorded seven deaths, including a city worker with the Department of Correction. De Blasio said the man worked as an investigator and was not recently inside any correctional facility.  De Blasio announced that five new coronavirus drive-through testing centers will arrive in New York City in the coming days.  City officials did not provide immediate details on where the testing facilities will be located, but de Blasio stressed the drive through testing will be available for priority cases and by appointment only.  The mayor also signed an executive order Monday, suspending all visits to correctional facilities, mandating business closures for restaurants, bars, cafes, gyms and other public spaces and requiring all hospitals to suspend elective surgeries within the next 96 hours.  The order also suspends upcoming City Council hearings, land use procedures and suspends procurement rules in order to speed up contracting with certain businesses.  The mayor called on New Yorkers to exercise extreme caution in the coming days, encouraging people to avoid going outside, public gatherings and work from home.  “In general, the simple rule is when in doubt, stay home,” de Blasio said during the briefing.  De Blasio, who was fiercely criticized for continuing his usual morning workout at the Park Slope YMCA Monday morning — even as he warned New Yorkers to avoid such places — defended his decision.  \"I knew in advance it was a very socially distanced situation. Almost no one was there,\" de Blasio said Monday when asked if he was ignoring his own advice during a public health crisis.  The mayor said New Yorkers will still have access to the city’s parks and open spaces, but they should exercise social distance if they’re spending time outside.  De Blasio was also critical of the federal response to the coronavirus crisis so far, saying the administration failed to prepare weeks in advance as signs of a growing epidemic were being reported.  The mayor said the city is currently working to expand hospital bed capacity by bringing hospital facilities back online as early as next week.  The new facilities include the Health + Hospitals Coler facility on Roosevelt Island, a recently built nursing home in Brooklyn, the Westchester Square Hospital in the Bronx and the North Central Bronx Hospital. In total, city officials estimate an additional 1,200 to 1,300 hospital beds will come online next week as a result.'"

       "'What to Know U.S. coronavirus cases have surpassed 2,000; more than four dozen people have died, including two people in New Jersey and two people in New York  The state of New York has more than 700 cases; most of the cases are in NYC and Westchester  Governors in New York and New Jersey have declared states of emergency, and the usage of public transit is plunging  Two people died from coronavirus-related deaths in New York - the state\\'s first reported deaths - and a second people died in New Jersey, the governors from both states announced Saturday.  A woman in her 50s died in Monmouth County, Governor Phil Murphy tweeted Saturday night. It was not immediately clear if the woman had any previous or underlying health conditions that may have contributed to her death.  Earlier in the day, New York state officials announced the state\\'s first deaths: a 64-year-old Rockland County man and an 82-year-old woman from New York City.  The New York City woman was hospitalized in Brooklyn on March 3 after contracting the novel coronavirus \"on top of the emphysema,\" Cuomo said during a teleconference Saturday. The case marked the first death of a person in New York State \"who had the coronavirus with the underlying symptoms,\" he said.  Fewer details were immediately released about the death of the Rockland County individual. The medical examiner confirmed the death was within the Village of Suffern on and tested positive for COVID-19. A source familiar with the case told News 4 that the victim died at their home in the Village of Suffern on Saturday and had not been previously tested for the coronavirus.  \"The decedent was 64 years old and had other significant health problems which were likely contributory to death,\" a statement from the medical examiner said.  The number of positive cases in the state also increased to 613 by Saturday evening, Cuomo said. 269 of the 613 cases are in New York City; 178 are in Westchester County; 79 are in Nassau County; 41 are in Suffolk County; 12 are in Rockland County; 6 are in Orange County; 5 are in Albany County; 4 are in Dutchess County; 3 are in Erie County. A complete breakdown of the numbers can be found here.  Tioga, Tompkins, and Erie counties each saw their first confirmed positive cases, Cuomo said.  \"The more tests we take, the more that number will go up,\" Cuomo noted. \"We believe there are thousands of people who have coronavirus [in the state]. Maybe tens of thousands.\"  Cuomo on Saturday also encouraged New Yorkers to seek health advice remotely, saying the state would waive copayments for insurers “for any telemedicine visits.”  At a press conference on Saturday afternoon, meanwhile, Vice President Mike Pence announced the U.S. would expand its travel ban to include the United Kingdom and Ireland.  Mayor Bill de Blasio on Saturday noted that the 82-year-old woman who died had been in critical condition since she was admitted to Wyckoff Heights Medical Center in Brooklyn.  Amid a dramatic rise in cases across New York, two state lawmakers tested positive for the virus, Gov. Cuomo confirmed late Saturday.  \"It has come to our attention that two of our Assembly colleagues - Helene Weinstein and Charles Barron - have been diagnosed with COVID-19,\" the governor said. He also noted that neither had been to the Capitol since early March, but out of an abundance of caution it would be closed to visitors on Sunday.  Among the cases yet to be confirmed, that of a New York City school safety agent. Three senior city officials told News 4 the woman tested positive for COVID-19, which she contracted her husband, a taxi driver.  Officials from her union said she hasn\\'t been in the Queens elementary school since March 4. Pending official confirmation, the school would be required to close for a 24-period to clean as a precaution.  Thirty people in New York City were hospitalized due to the novel coronavirus as of Saturday afternoon, 19 of whom were in intensive care, de Blasio noted. Eighty percent of those hospitalized were over 50 years old and/or have pre-existing conditions, he said. One of the new confirmed cases is an FDNY member who works at a firehouse in Brooklyn; 31 members of the firehouse have been quarantined \"as a matter of precaution,\" de Blasio said.  Gov. Phil Murphy also announced an increase in the number of positive tests in New Jersey on Saturday afternoon, saying that 19 new cases since Friday had brought the state\\'s total to 69.  After dealing with seemingly nothing but bad news for the past couple of days — including even more COVID-19 cases, New York State and New York City declaring states of emergency, Broadway going dark, the sports world entirely put on hold, and a national emergency being declared — there was a bit of good news Friday.  In a time when bipartisan bills can be very tough to come by, President Donald Trump cheered for the House\\'s passing of the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which calls for free testing, two weeks of sick pay for workers, enhanced unemployment benefits and bolstered food programs.  While that won\\'t exactly make up for New York City almost becoming a \"ghost town,\" it may help some people, especially those who have been worrying about taking off work either for themselves or for their children, many of whom in the tri-state have had classes canceled for extended periods.  However, there are almost guaranteed to be more sobering numbers regarding coronavirus cases coming out in the coming week, as officials expect more to keep coming all over the tri-state — and could expect to see increases for months. On Saturday, Cuomo said New York is now among the hardest-hit states in the country, with 613 cases of COVID-19 — including more than 200 in New York City.  There were at least 35 COVID-19 cases in Manhattan, 26 in Queens, 24 in Brooklyn, 13 in the Bronx and five on Staten Island. One of the Staten Island cases involved a special education student from the Richard Hungerford School at New Dorp High School. That school was closed Friday and will be cleaned over the weekend, with the hopes of reopening on Monday.  A teacher at the Brooklyn Occupational Training center also self-reported having the virus, which tests later confirmed. Officials have since closed the school, and because there are medically fragile students who attend, is was not known when the school would be cleared to reopen.  \"This is going to be everywhere,\" Cuomo said. \"My guess is there are thousands and thousands of cases walking around the state of New York.\"  Meanwhile, Murphy said it was an \"inevitability\" that all schools in the state would close, and he raised the prospect of taking the recommended 250-person limit on gatherings and making it mandatory.  President Trump\\'s national emergency declaration freed up another $50 billion for more relief efforts. He also enlisted some of the nation\\'s largest retailers, including Walmart and Target, to host drive-thru testing in their parking lots.  In New York City, Mayor Bill de Blasio doubled down on his decision to keep the city\\'s public schools open, saying he fears the \"unintended consequences\" of what could happen should they close their doors.  One of the biggest questions we hear about the coronavirus: how long does it live? Chris Glorioso has the answers.  \"I understand the anxieties right now. My strong belief is schools weren\\'t open, children would go all over looking for something to do ... no pristine quarantine,\" de Blasio said, adding that parents he talked to agreed that without school, kids would go hang out with their friends and go anywhere — thereby defeating the purpose of any quarantine-like scenario.  \"I think there is an illusion you can shut down schools temporarily. If you shut down, you have to be ready that that\\'s it for the school year — that could be it for the calendar year,\" he said.  Despite some private schools and universities closing around the city, as well as calls online to #CloseNYCSchools, the mayor said that they are going to try their \"damnedest\" to keep New York City schools open as long as possible. Many have asked why, particularly when large-scale venues are shutting down to try to reduce density in any one space at one time.  “The danger of going to a full shutdown is it will degrade not only people\\'s lives on a host of matters, including their health and safety and other ways,” de Blasio said. Some people have to work, the mayor added, noting, \"That includes a lot of parents we depend on, first responders, health care professionals -- it’s a very slippery slope.”  Attendance in city schools did take a significant dip on Friday, with schools reporting just 68 percent of students attending on Friday — down from above 80 percent Thursday. There was also a slight uptick in teacher absenteeism Friday, according to a city official.  \"I think there\\'s a shock right now, the last few days have been a shock to the system,\" the mayor said. \"I want to see where things are in a week or two weeks.\"  Parents who do opt to hold their children out of school as a precaution, though, should know that their kids will not be penalized for being absent. even with more students not attending school, the mayor said there was no \"hard and fast\" threshold set for when he would consider closing schools.  Get full details on those closures and other school impacts across the tri-state here.  De Blasio signed a state of emergency declaration for the city on Thursday, cautioning the surge in positive tests is far from over and projecting the five boroughs could see 1,000 cases by next week. Just Friday morning, a member of the New York City Council, Bronx councilman Fernando Cabrera, posted on Facebook that his son has caught the virus -- and warned members of their church, where the elder Cabrera is pastor, to take precautions.  The surge in cases has already triggered huge public anxiety despite authorities\\' best efforts to make the health facts clear: Eighty percent of people who get COVID-19 self-resolve without medical treatment; the vast majority of city- and state-run tests have been negative and the overall risk to the general public is low. That said, the spread must be contained -- primarily to protect the most vulnerable populations like the sick or elderly.  To further those efforts, Cuomo opened a drive-thru testing center in crisis epicenter New Rochelle on Friday, a six-lane facility that can test the occupants of up to 200 cars per day.  Those who want to arrange testing at the New Rochelle facility can call 888-364-3065  \"We do have a crisis in testing. We\\'re not up to scale,\" Cuomo said.  He enacted sweeping directives earlier Thursday, banning crowds of 500 people or more and darkening Broadway. How long will it all last? De Blasio said large venues, including Madison Square Garden and Barclays Center, could be shuttered through as late as September. Broadway is scheduled to reopen next month.  \"The prism I\\'m looking at this from is: this is war,\" the mayor said.  The situation is highly fluid, though, and de Blasio said \"every scenario\" is regularly being evaluated.  The mayor also repeated his call on Friday that more facemasks were needed for the city, in order to supply first repsonders and those could be treating infected patients, especially hospital workers. He said that the city has just over 500,000 masks, but they want 2.2 million more  What could come next? De Blasio detailed which measures could be taken by the city in order to help contain the outbreak as authorized by the city\\'s state of emergency. While he made it clear that none of these measures have been activated, the order enables him to issue directives including:  Enacting a city-wide curfew  Controlling which vehicles can enter and leave parts of city  Closing down public transportation  Ordering hospitals to postpone elective surgeries  Putting rations on certain supplies  Suspending sales of alcohol, firearms and other items  Prohibiting or restricting number of people on streets and public places  Regulating or closing public spaces  Enacting emergency shelters  Limiting maximum building occupancies  Any decision to halt MTA service would come from Cuomo in concert with medical professionals, the agency\\'s chairman said on \"Good Day New York.\"  In the meantime, \"Mass transit is not shutting down. The system is safe,\" MTA Chairman Pat Foye said.  The MTA said Friday that Long Island Rail Road ridership is down 31 percent, Metro North ridership is off 48 percent, subway traffic is down 19 percent and bus usage is down 15 percent.  Meanwhile, New Jersey now has at least 69 cases and Connecticut has 14 presumed positives, most of which were in Fairfield County. See a tri-state case breakdown here.  Nearly half of the state\\'s cases are in Westchester County, where the midtown Manhattan lawyer linked to what Cuomo has called \"the most significant cluster\" in the nation lives with his family in New Rochelle. He is one of the relatively few COVID-19 patients to still be hospitalized.  The CDC said this week it would send more than half a billion dollars to state and local jurisdictions for COVID-19 response, but both Cuomo and de Blasio have slammed the federal government for what they have described essentially as a \"too little, too late\" — and woefully slow — response.  Cuomo described the government lack of testing as the \"public health version of Hurricane Katrina.\" Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged testing has been an issue since the start of the outbreak, but said every state now has testing capability at state labs, and that the U.S. is working to expand number and access to coronavirus tests in all 50 states, also via commercial and private labs like Labcorp and Quest.  In an effort to control the spread of the virus, the Department of Homeland Security on Friday put out a list of airports that U.S. citizens, legal residents and their immediate families are required to travel through to re-enter the country if they are coming from certain European countries, China and Iran. Of the 13 airports listed, New York CIty\\'s JFK Airport and New Jersey\\'s Newark Airport were both listed.  Local governments are also implementing changes — some major, some minor — that may impact the daily lives of people who will never get COVID-19. Here\\'s a breakdown of what\\'s happening in that regard by state.  How to Protect Yourself  New York City\\'s Health Department released the following guidance for people who recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea -- or for anyone who experiences fever, cough or shortness of breath:  Stay home — do not travel or go to work or school while sick  Go to a health care provider and tell them about your travel history If you do not have a health care provider or insurance, call 311  Avoid contact with others  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available  Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands  The New Jersey State Department of Health has established a 24-hour coronavirus hotline to answer questions: 800-222-1222. New York has a similar hotline set up: 888-364-3065.  As of late Friday morning, NBC News reported more than 2,300 cases and 51 deaths nationwide; 37 of the fatalities have been in Washington state, where America\\'s very first case was reported.  In more than 1,300 of those cases, authorities still don\\'t know how the virus was contracted. That total number is only updated once a weekday though and reporting closes out at 4 p.m. the day before. The actual case total could be higher.  Help may be on the way. President Trump has signed an $8.3 billion measure to fuel national efforts to combat the spread. The legislation provides sustenance for a multifaceted attack -- money for vaccines, tests, potential treatments and to help local governments respond to the virus.  Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 132,000 people and killed more than 5,000, according to the World Health Organization. CDC officials warned for weeks to expect a disruptive spread of the virus in America. Here\\'s where we stand now as far as developing a vaccine. On Wednesday, the World Health Organization said it had made the assessment that COVID-19 could be characterized as a \"pandemic.\"'"

       "'What to Know The number of novel coronavirus cases in the tri-state area surged by 216 percent between late Friday and Monday afternoon, from 49 cases to 156  New York was up to at least 143 cases statewide, 20 of them in the five boroughs, as of Monday evening; the lion\\'s share of those cases are in Westchester County  New Jersey had 11 positive samples that had been sent to the CDC for confirmation, and Gov. Murphy declared a state of emergency; Connecticut saw its second presumptive positive as well  UPDATE: NJ Announces 1st COVID-19 Death; NY Deploys National Guard to New Rochelle  The number of coronavirus cases in the tri-state area has tripled since Friday — surging from 49 cases to 156 — and leading New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to declare a state of emergency to declare a state of emergency.  As of Monday afternoon, New York has the most cases of COVID-19 in the country. That includes new cases in Westchester County, which has become one of the nation\\'s biggest COVID-19 hotspots. One of those includes a medical professional at Westmed Medical Group in White Plains, a Monday evening memo from the company said. The man has been in self-quarantine since before he showed symptoms, and the Department of Health said no additional testing is necessary for any staff or patients who came in contact with him.  Among the new cases in New York City were a 7-year-old, an FDNY EMS and Port Authority of New York and New Jersey Executive Director Rick Cotton, government officials said Monday.  Department of Health Officials said that some who were in contact with Cotton should adhere to a 14-day quarantine policy, with March 6 being the earliest possibly date of concern for transmission. Port Authority noted that Cotton was not at the airport on Friday or over the weekend.  Rick Cotton, the point person for infrastructure projects like the overhauls at JFK and LaGaurdia, learned he came down with the coronavirus Sunday night. NBC New York’s Pei-Sze Cheng reports.  In addition to those, new instances include multiple cases in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx; and Nassau and Rockland counties, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio said Monday. Cuomo also confirmed Cotton was among the new positives and said he would be working from home. Cotton\\'s senior team will also be tested, so several of them may be quarantined as well.  Of the eight new New York City cases announced Monday afternoon, one of the most notable is a 7-year-old Bronx girl who attends the Westchester Torah Academy, one of the schools linked to the earliest-identified cases in New Rochelle. Mayor de Blasio says she is quarantined at home and appears to be doing well. He also said they are \"very, very worried about\" a diabetic Queens man, 75, who was taken to the ICU after developing symptoms.  New York Governor Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio asked sick people to stay off public transit, especially subways and buses, as number of COVID-19 cases in the state continues to grow. NBC New York\\'s Ida Siegal reports.  A union for EMS confirmed that a first responder tested positive for coronavirus as well, the first emergency worker to contract the virus. The union president said the EMS works in Brooklyn, and has been quarantined at home.  According to the FDNY, the member was not exposed through patient contact, but rather is believed to have gotten the virus from an individual who recently traveled overseas. The first responder was not showing symptoms, the FDNY said, but treated 11 patients while partnered with five coworkers during three shifts last week.  There are 19 total members of the FDNY under quarantine.  Also in New York City, The Tour at NBC Studios suspended operations for the month of March as a result of the virus.  New Jersey confirmed another five presumptive positives Monday afternoon, bringing its total to 11 and leading Gov. Murphy to declare a state of emergency and a public heath emergency.  BREAKING: I’m declaring a State of Emergency for New Jersey amid an outbreak of #COVID19.    We’ve been ahead of the curve in terms of our preparations, and this declaration will help keep us there.⁰⁰For more information, visit https://t.co/UyohzX5yGkhttps://t.co/ACoJrkLgJm pic.twitter.com/9gINlZKB1f — Governor Phil Murphy (@GovMurphy) March 9, 2020  “The State of New Jersey is committed to deploying every available resource, across all levels of government, to help respond to the spread of COVID-19 and keep our residents informed,” said Governor Murphy. “My Administration will continue to work closely with our federal partners to ensure that local health agencies on the front lines of the state’s response are equipped with the resources needed to further prepare our health care system for a broader spread of COVID-19.”  The declaration also prohibits \"excessive price increases\" and gives the state the ability to waive some procedures in order to get necessary goods and services expedited.  With five more presumptive cases, there are now nearly a dozen patients being treated for coronavirus in New Jersey. One is a 27-year-old who attended a conference in Boston in February, where there may have been widespread infection. NBC New York’s Ida Siegal reports.  One of the presumptive positives is said to have attended a Biogen conference in Boston; NJ state health officials said dozens of conference-goers have since tested positive. See the latest case count breakdown by state here.  On Monday evening, Connecticut got its second confirmed case of coronavirus, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. There were no details immediately available regarding the latest patient, including their condition, how the virus was contracted or if they were exhibiting symptoms.  Monday\\'s developments follow an active weekend. Cuomo declared a state of emergency for New York amid the surge in case count, reiterating that enhanced testing ability leads to a boom in positives by default. That spread is prompting some schools to suspend classes. Cuomo issued new guidance Monday for all New York schools: If a student tests positive, that school will be closed for a 24-hour period pending an assessment. Longer closures may be required. See the latest school closures.  As of Monday, the largest concentration of New York cases is in suburban Westchester County, where the midtown Manhattan lawyer linked to the biggest web of cases lives. His community, New Rochelle, is not just a significant outbreak hotspot in the state but nationally, and Cuomo said Monday that people should expect extended school closures there.  That lawyer marked the state\\'s first-discovered case of community spread, though the region has since seen other instances of that, including in the five boroughs.  Authorities have said increasing testing ability will lead to more confirmed cases by default -- and that the general risk to the overall public remains low. Just eight of the more than 150 patients in New York state are hospitalized, Cuomo pointed out. Tri-state residents should expect many more positives to come amid a state- and city-wide push to enhance testing capacity even further to better combat the spread of the novel coronavirus, officials say.  NBC New York\\'s Myles Miller reports.  Cuomo, who announced Sunday that the federal government has approved a Nassau County laboratory to begin manual testing of coronavirus samples, called on the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to allow more private laboratories to do testing to greatly expand testing capacity.  De Blasio has expressed similar urgency -- and he had a brief but poignant message for all New Yorkers Monday: \"If you are sick, STAY HOME.\" Twenty-four people were under mandatory quarantine in New York City as of Monday, when the number of cases climbed once again -- to 20.  With the number of COVID-19 cases growing, we know there’s a lot of anxiety and confusion out there.    Here are some things that EVERY New Yorker can do to help reduce the spread of COVID-19: pic.twitter.com/kXrSKOfTs6 — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 8, 2020  The city has issued new guidelines for commuters, including suggesting people telecommute and avoid crowded trains if possible. The U.S. State Department has cautioned against cruises, particularly for people who have underlying health concerns. Community events have been canceled as a precaution. New York state is now producing its own hand sanitizer.  Local governments are implementing changes — some major, some minor — that may impact the daily lives of people who will never get COVID-19. Here\\'s a breakdown of what\\'s happening in that regard by state.

New York has a similar hotline set up: 888-364-3065.  Nationally, the CDC says that as of Monday, it had 423 cases and 19 deaths reported from 34 states and Washington, D.C. In more than 300 of those cases, authorities still don\\'t know how the virus was contracted. That total number is only updated once a weekday though and reporting closes out at 4 p.m. the day before. The actual case total could be higher.  As of late Monday night, NBC News reported at least 702 cases and 26 deaths nationwide; 22 of the fatalities have been in Washington state, where America\\'s very first case was reported.  Stocks plunged Monday — with the Dow sinking more than 2,000 points and the S&P 500 cratering more than 7 percent. A circuit breaker was triggered in the morning, which halted stock trading for 15 minutes meant in an effort to stem rapid declines. Even with the circuit breaker, the Dow had its worst one-day beating on Wall Street since the global financial crisis of 2008.  On Friday, President Trump signed an $8.3 billion measure to fuel national efforts to combat the spread.

       "'NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) – Gov. Andrew Cuomo declared a state of emergency Saturday as the number of coronavirus cases in the state soared.  As of Saturday night, there were a total of 89 cases in New York State.  Eleven of those confirmed cases were in New York City. The majority of the cases are in Westchester County.  Update: There are 13 additional cases of #Coronavirus in NYS since earlier today, bringing total to 89. Westchester: 70  NYC: 11  Nassau: 4  Rockland: 2  Saratoga: 2 There will be more cases as we test more—that’s a good thing bc we can deal with the situation based on more facts. — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) March 7, 2020  Mayor Bill de Blasio said seven new cases in the city were confirmed Saturday morning.  “We are seeing more community transmission between people who have no direct connection to travel to one of the affected countries,” de Blasio said in a statement. “I urge New Yorkers to remain vigilant—not alarmed—and take the necessary precautions to protect themselves and their loved ones. As we continue to see more cases of COVID-19, we will be providing as much guidance to New Yorkers as possible to keep our city safe.”  The seven new cases include the wife and 11-year-old daughter of an Upper West Side man who had previously tested positive, a man who is currently hospitalized in Queens, two Brooklyn women who were recently on a cruise from Egypt, a Brooklyn man who recently returned from Italy and a Manhattan man who spent time with someone who tested positive for coronavirus in Chile.  The two Brooklyn women are at home in mandatory quarantine, as are the wife and daughter of the Upper West Side man.  The Manhattan man was discharged from a local hospital Saturday morning and is under mandatory quarantine.  The Brooklyn man who recently returned from Italy is in a local hospital in serious condition. Officials say the man is in his 30s.  Officials say the man who is currently hospitalized in Queens is in his 30s and is an Uber driver who drives on Long Island. He is not a Taxi and Limousine Commission licensed driver.  CBS2’s Kevin Rincon reports State Sen. James Sanders Jr. says the case in Far Rockaway, Queens, is at St. John’s Episcopal Hospital and as a result 40 workers have been quarantined.  In a release, de Blasio said, “There is no impact to hospital operations. The Department of Health is monitoring carefully at the direction of the mayor.”  CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  Officials also said that three New York City Public Schools teachers who had recently traveled to Italy all tested negative for the coronavirus.  When asked about risks to people coming into New York City for conventions, sporting events or concerts, Cuomo urged caution about large gatherings, especially for the elderly.  “If you are a senior citizen, I would think seriously about attending a large gathering now,” said Cuomo. “I’ve said that to my mother.”  Cuomo also noted 73 CUNY students flying back to New York after being recalled from overseas studies in Rome would be rerouted to land at JFK Airport where they had better facilities to process them.  Flight from Rome to JFK expected this evening, returning approx 100 CUNY/SUNY students from overseas study. @NYGovCuomo has said they will quarantine for 14 days due to #COVID19 concerns. Arrival will be handled at non-general aviation hangar with PAPD, CBP, and CDC present. — Tony Aiello (@AielloTV) March 7, 2020  Those students are expected to be in quarantine for 14 days, and those who could not self-quarantine at home would be placed in dormitory lodging in New York.  Long Island’s first case was confirmed Thursday in Nassau County.  In a message to students, Uniondale Superintendent Dr. William Lloyd identified the patient as a 42-year-old man from Uniondale. The man is undergoing treatment at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola.  The majority of the New York cases are connected to a 50-year-old attorney from New Rochelle who works in Manhattan.  “One becomes two, becomes four, becomes 10, becomes 12,” Cuomo said. “Then 12 people go out and touch 200, and 200 touch 400, and 400 touch 800, and that’s what we’re now dealing with.”  Cuomo said that in Westchester County, all the new cases there were related to the New Rochelle cluster.  “If you had said day 1, everyone in New Rochelle must stay in their home, it could have reduced the rate,” he said. “‘Mandatory quarantine for everyone.’ That’s easier to do in China, but it would be tremendously disruptive to the economy, but there is no doubt massive quarantine is the best way to slow the spread.”  Cuomo also announced outside visitors will be temporarily banned from New Rochelle nursing homes and senior centers.  Residents in the area have been receiving that information in robocalls from the mayor. In addition to the nursing home protocol, Mayor Noam Bramson also says the state will be setting up a local command center in New Rochelle.  Officials with Westchester Day School — a private independent school in the Village of Mamaroneck — say that a student tested positive for the coronavirus. They learned about the test results Thursday. The school will be closed until March 17.  Precautions are being taken throughout the area in Westchester County.  In White Plains, the Maple Medical Group at 30 Davis Avenue is closed and being cleaned and disinfected after a doctor there tested positive for the coronavirus. His wife and four children have also tested positive, and are under self-quarantine. Workers have been tested and they’re determining which patients need to be contacted.  The Mastercard office building in Purchase closed after being visited by an employee from Brazil diagnosed with the virus.  Rabbi Reuven Fink, the rabbi of Young Israel of New Rochelle where the attorney at the center of most cases worships, is also among the more than a dozen patients connected to the lawyer. Rabbi Fink also teaches at Yeshiva University.  “Rabbi Reuven Fink, the Rabbi of the Young Israel of New Rochelle, who has been in self-quarantine for being in contact with his congregant who has tested positive has announced to his congregation that he also tested positive with the coronavirus,” the school posted overnight. “Rabbi Fink teaches two undergraduate classes at our Washington Heights campus. We have reached out to his students and recommended as a precautionary measure to self-quarantine until further notice.  Yeshiva University’s Washington Heights and Midtown campuses have been closed for cleaning. They’re expected to reopen Tuesday.  Friday night, Connecticut’s governor announced that a Westchester County resident who tested positive for coronavirus works at Danbury Hospital in Danbury, Connecticut, and Norwalk Hospital in Norwalk, Connecticut. Hospital officials say before she self-quarantined in her home, she came in contact with a limited number of patients and some employees between the two hospitals.  “We have one of the great hospital systems in the country and if anybody’s ready to handle this, it’s Danbury Hospital,” Gov. Ned Lamont said.  Watch: Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont, Health Officials Address Hospital Employee Who Tested Positive For Coronavirus —  Rockland County announced its first cases of the virus earlier this week.  “We’re here to inform you that we have two cases of coronavirus here in Rockland County. This is no surprise. This is what we were expecting for a while now,” said Rockland County Health Commissioner Dr. Patricia Ruppert.  Dr. Ruppert said they’re doing well at home.  Watch: Rockland County Officials On Coronavirus  Despite the rise in cases Saturday, Cuomo said the overall health risk to the state remained low.  I am declaring a State of Emergency for New York amid an outbreak of #Coronavirus. We will continue to provide updates to New Yorkers. For more information on #COVID19, visit:https://t.co/u23HkuJln1 — Andrew Cuomo (@NYGovCuomo) March 7, 2020  Leaders say the state of emergency is actually a good thing in this case because it means more federal resources will be coming our way, CBS2’s John Dias reports.  “This is not to make you panic. It basically means that the state is allowing us to get federal and state resources,” Nassau County Executive Laura Curran said. “It will also allow our EMS personnel to transports patients to quarantine locations other than hospitals should the need arise.”  She says a state of emergency also means qualified professionals other than doctors and nurses will be able to administer coronavirus testing kits.  In the tri-state area and across the country, however, the actual tests are still hard to come by.  “We know that we have to be careful about who we test. They have to have criteria and symptoms that match or you’re just wasting a limited supply,” said Dr. Lawrence Eisenstein, Nassau County health commissioner.  On Long Island, Northwell Health is now getting the green light to test people as infected patients are quarantined at both Mercy Medical Center and NYU Winthrop Hospital. The commissioner of the Nassau County Office of Emergency Management says they plan to start a soft activation Sunday, which they do when there are terrorist threats or major weather events.  “It’s a central location for everybody to meet to get the help and resources that they need,” said Steven Morelli, emergency management office commissioner. “We’ll also be fielding information from the local hospitals, so they can let us know should their census begin to increase, that their emergency rooms are starting to fill up with people saying they’re not feeling well.”  Cuomo again reiterated 80% of those infected will self-resolve, 20% may get ill and may require hospitalization, and it is most problematic for senior citizens, people with underlying conditions or compromised immune systems.  Health officials emphasized the illness was airborne and could only be transmitted through fluids. City officials also said they believe the virus can only live on most household surfaces for a few minutes.  The governor added New York health officials are looking at responses in China since the outbreak began there, including the use of telemedicine to diagnose and help patients without them leaving their homes.  According to CBS Baltimore, health officials in Washington, D.C., say two people from New York who tested positive for the coronavirus attended the American Israel Public Affairs Committee conference there. Health officials say neither patient reported any symptoms while they were at the conference and there was no risk to other conference attendees.  Meanwhile, Amtrak is taking measures to prevent the spread of coronavirus. Starting Tuesday, Acela non-stop service trains between New York and D.C. will be suspended until May 26. The change does not affect Amtrak’s other high-speed Acela service. The railroad will waive change fees on reservations made through April 30. Amtrak says it’s also increasing the frequency of cleaning service on trains and at stations to multiple times a day.  As coronavirus concerns build, many worries now center around testing to determine how many are infected. There are questions as to how many test kits are currently available in New York and across the country.  This is especially important since not everyone shows symptoms.  This week Cuomo had outlined testing priorities in New York going forward:  Those who have been in close proximity to a person who has already tested positive People who have traveled to a country with level 2 or 3 health notice from the CDC and are experiencing symptoms People in quarantine and develop symptoms while in quarantine A seriously ill individual who has not tested positive for other viruses  Cuomo also said violating voluntary quarantine rules is disrespectful to members of the community because it puts others at risk. He also says if you don’t comply with it, there are other measures leaders are willing to take, but he did not go into specifics.  New Jersey had confirmed four cases, reported CBS2’s Tara Jakeway on Saturday morning. Three were residents from Bergen County and one from Camden County.  According to New Jersey Department of Health Acting Commissioner Judith Persichilli, an additional four patients have tests pending while another 15 people are under investigation with testing expected to come late Saturday or Sunday.  Friday morning, President Donald Trump signed a sweeping spending bill to combat the spread of coronavirus, pumping $8.3 billion into prevention efforts.  “I asked for 2.5 and I got 8.3. I’ll take it,” Trump said.  Money from the bill will also go towards research to produce a vaccine.  It comes a day after Vice President Mike Pence, who is leading the administration’s admitted a shortfall in the number of coronavirus testing kits that are available.  “We don’t have enough tests today to meet what we anticipate will be the demand going forward,” Pence said.  Congress is investigating the slow rollout of the kits, which are just now reaching labs across the country. There are only 400,000 tests available nationally.'"

       "\"NEW YORK (CBSNewYork) — Mayor Bill de Blasio signed an executive order closing restaurants, bars cafes, shutting down the Big Apple’s nightlife and says restaurants and bars may only provide take-out or delivery.  The closure will go into effect at 9 a.m. Tuesday.  De Blasio says remote learning for New York City schools will start on March 23, even as the public school system is shut down through April 20.  In addition, elective surgeries will be suspended, along with City Council Hearings, visits to inmates along with other suspensions including the special election for Queens borough president.  “In general, the rule is ‘When in doubt, stay home,'” de Blasio said. “If you’re not sure you need to do it, stay home. Limit your time outside… when you go out, be mindful of social distancing.”  Coronavirus in NYC as of 4pm Mon:  463 confirmed cases citywide  -118 Queens  -111 Manhattan  -62 Brooklyn  -34 Bronx  -19 Staten Island  Total 7 deaths in NYC@CBSNewYork — Ali Bauman (@AliBaumanTV) March 16, 2020  The number of confirmed cases in New York City continues to climb. There are now 463 citywide including seven deaths. One of those who has died is a Department of Correction investigator. De Blasio said he did not have contact with inmates.  “It will get a lot worse before it gets better,” de Blasio said. “We understand that so many people are going to be affected by this.”  “The answer is for all of us to work together and support each other,” he added.  De Blasio said he is gravely concerned about New York City’s hospital capacity, and is looking to scale up the amount of beds and facilities available. Four facilities are being brought online in two weeks, adding roughly 1,200-1,300 beds.  As far as expanding existing hospital capacity, hospitals will discharge existing patients on an expedited basis, canceling elective surgeries and converting areas like parking lots and cafeterias, de Blasio said.  “We have no choice but to expand rapidly,” he said.  Tents are being purchased and deployed to be made into makeshift ICUs, de Blasio said.  FEMA is involved and New York City will have five drive-thru testing facilities soon.  De Blasio also said new rules will take aim at price-gouging on a host of products including thermometers, sanitizing wipes, baby wipes, paper towels, latex gloves, masks, fever reducers, facial tissue, toilet tissue, rubbing alcohol, aloe vera and more.  People who detect price gouging should call 311, and the mayor urges folks to be specific about where exactly and what they’re seeing.  CORONAVIRUS OUTBREAK  The mayor said the restaurant decision was not one he took lightly.  Sunday night, de Blasio ordered cafes and restaurants to close their dining rooms. Meaning, businesses can only serve take-out or fill delivery orders.  Enforcement against delivery e-bikes will be suspended during the duration of the crisis, de Blasio said.  These are drastic changes for the greater good, say city and state officials. But the closures will hurt not just business owners, but their employees.  Fears of the coronavirus have already had an impact.  “In the last week, business is down by 80%. Cut my staff. Every day, everyone is just afraid to come out. Locals are staying home and hiding, and we’re trying to get by,” said Noel Hernandez, the manager at JoJo’s Philosophy in the Village.  Hernandez says this is sort of drop off is unsustainable.  “This is really bad. I have no idea. We have to pay rent, and I don’t think the landlord cares. We’ll do our best and see what happens,” he said.  Many New Yorkers CBS2’s Kevin Rincon spoke with are worried that whenever things get back to normal, it won’t look or feel the same.  “A lot of these place pay the really high rents, and they don’t last and go out anyway, so this is going to push them over the edge I’m afraid,” said Greenwich Village resident Paulette Mooney. “We just have to pray, and hope it turns out well for everyone.”  At City Hall, de Blasio was asked what, if anything, the city can do to help.  “Immediately, we are seeing working people with much less money in their pockets and tremendous fear about what’s going to happen next,” de Blasio said. “There should be a small sense of relief is that the House of Representatives acted on Friday, but it’s not enough we need more.”  For now, the mayor says people can still order take out and delivery, but even that has changed.  “And the deliveries. I had a lot of deliveries before. Right now only one a day. So not even deliveries, no nothing,” one delivery worker said.  As for the few delivery riders still opting to work, they have concerns.  “Right now, I’m a bit nervous. I don’t know if I’m going to make enough money to pay my bills, take care of myself and my family,” said a delivery worker.  The restriction also shuts down movie theaters, small theater houses and concert venues. Clubs and bars with no food will be required to fully close, as well.  “It’s a necessary annoyance,” Manhattan resident Paris Brown told CBS2’s John Dias. “They’ve got to protect us, our lives.”  “I’m thinking if we do this, it’ll open sooner. If we leave them open and everybody gets sick, then everything gets closed for months,” said Anthony Picco, of Hell’s Kitchen.  “It’s blind, unreasoning panic, fear-driven panic,” Paull Weiss, also of Hell’s Kitchen, added. “Everybody should be cautious, but this is going way too far.”  The city’s department of health tweeted, “Everyone in NYC should act as if they have been exposed to coronavirus.”  ** New #COVID19 guidance for New York City **  Everyone in NYC should act as if they have been exposed to coronavirus. That means monitoring your health closely and staying home from work if you are sick. New Yorkers who are not sick should also stay home as much as possible. — nycHealthy (@nycHealthy) March 16, 2020  “Our lives are changing in ways that were unimaginable just a week ago. We are taking a series of actions that we never would have taken otherwise in an effort to save the lives of loved ones and our neighbors,” de Blasio said.  Our lives are all changing in ways that were unimaginable just a week ago. We are taking a series of actions that we never would have taken otherwise in an effort to save the lives of loved ones and our neighbors. Now it is time to take yet another drastic step. — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) March 16, 2020  The new restrictions left hospitality workers scrambling. The mayor has not said how long they will last or if the city will offer financial support to help those impacted by it.  “I work in the restaurant industry, so yes, absolutely I’m scared. Will I have a job tomorrow?” said Bensonhurst resident Paul Miller. “I don’t know what’s going on.”  The owner of Galaxy Diner in Hell’s Kitchen and his staff spent their last day open rearranging furniture so customers could practice social distancing. They don’t know how they will bounce back.  “What can I say? I don’t know, I cannot predict the future. We have to close, we got to close,” the manager said.  A few blocks away at Cosmic Diner, workers were in shock. The owner said he didn’t know what he was going to do about his employees.  The president of the Queens Chamber of Commerce said the chamber coalition is trying to think of ways to keep businesses alive.  “Put together some thoughts about suspending income tax payments, suspending a whole bunch of different things that go on in a normal course of business, at least for the months of March and April and see where that goes,” Tom Grech said. “The forced shutdown is definitely unprecedented, and we are in territory I don’t think any of us in the modern age have ever seen.”  Similar measures have been announced in major cities across American and Western Europe.  In other coronavirus-related closures, the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island will also be shutting down today. It’s unclear when they will reopen.\""

       "'New York Governor Andrew Cuomo speaks during a press conference to discuss the first positive case of novel coronavirus or COVID-19 in New York State on March 2, 2020 in New York City. Angela Weiss | AFP | Getty Images  The COVID-19 outbreak in New York state has spread to about 1,700 people, hospitalizing 19% of them and killing at least 12, state officials announced Tuesday. They said the number of cases will continue to rise as the state receives more test results. The state is scrambling to expand its hospital capacity to handle an influx of cases before infections peak in an estimated 45 days, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press conference in Albany. New York has 53,000 hospital beds and 3,000 ICU beds, far short of what state health officials are predicting will be needed, he said. They estimate the state will need at least 55,000 hospital beds and between 18,600 to 37,200 ICU beds at the peak of the outbreak. \"That, my friends, is the problem that we\\'ve been talking about since the beginning of this exercise,\" Cuomo said.  The fast-moving virus has spread to more than 183,000 people across the globe, killing more than 7,100, since emerging from Wuhan, China, less than three months ago. The number of cases changes by the minute. State officials are revising their data throughout the day, Cuomo\\'s spokesman Will Burns said. At the beginning of the press conference, Cuomo said the state had more than 1,300 cases with a hospitalization rate of 19%. About 30 minutes into the news conference, state Health Commissioner Dr. Howard Zucker told Cuomo the number of cases had increased to about 1,700. Cuomo\\'s data, according to Burns, was current as of midnight and given to Cuomo at 6 a.m. Zucker\\'s updated numbers will be revised later Tuesday. Cuomo joined the governors of New Jersey and Connecticut on Monday in announcing coordinated measures to reduce density throughout the region, citing \"a lack of federal direction and nationwide standards.\" The states are closing movie theaters and limiting public gatherings to fewer than 50 people. \"Our primary goal right now is to slow the spread of this virus so that the wave of new infections doesn\\'t crash our health-care system, and everyone agrees social distancing is the best way to do that,\" Cuomo said. \"This is not a war that can be won alone, which is why New York is partnering with our neighboring states to implement a uniform standard that not only keeps our people safe but also prevents \\'state shopping\\' where residents of one state travel to another and vice versa.\" Cuomo warned on Monday that the outbreak would stretch U.S. hospitals to their maximum capacity, saying the nation doesn\\'t have enough hospital beds to handle a pandemic. \"When we\\'re going to have a real problem is when cases hit their apex and descend on the health-care system and we will not have enough hospital beds,\" Cuomo said.'"

       "'It is not believed that the woman was contagious on her flight to New York or in the private car she took home from the airport. Still, officials said, they were trying to identify people who may have come into contact with her.  The state is instituting new testing and cleaning protocols.  In the previous month, nine people from New York City were declared free of the virus after they were tested by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Over the weekend, that testing protocol changed. Previously, the state could not test patients locally; it had to send samples to the C.D.C., in Atlanta. Now health officials in Manhattan and Albany can perform the tests, allowing for quicker results and more control over who is screened.  Mr. Cuomo said yesterday that he hoped that 1,000 samples could soon be tested per day.  He also said New York’s public health system was focused on reducing the spread of the outbreak. The state will begin new cleaning protocols in crowded public places, including schools and buses, he said.  Mr. de Blasio said the city had some 1,200 hospital beds that could be made available for coronavirus patients. He said that people who suspected they had the virus should contact 311 or go to a public health facility.  The outbreak could affect tourism.  NYC & Company, which monitors tourism in the city, has projected 285,000 fewer visitors this year from China. That would be a decline of more than 25 percent from the 1.1 million Chinese visitors last year.  China is the second-biggest source of international tourists to the city, behind Britain.  Through last weekend, restaurants, museums and Broadway shows were largely unaffected. But many stores became flooded with customers seeking supplies such as hand sanitizer, masks and antibacterial wipes. Several stores had run out of these items.'"

       "'Sign up for our COVID-19 newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest coronavirus news throughout New York City  A Manhattan woman has contracted coronavirus, the first confirmed case of the illness in New York City, officials announced Sunday night.  According to Mayor Bill de Blasio and Governor Andrew Cuomo, the patient is a woman in her 30s who picked up the illness during a recent trip to Iran. Cuomo said the patient “has respiratory symptoms, but is not in serious condition and has been in a controlled situation since arriving to (sic) New York.”  “From the beginning, we have said it was a matter of when, not if there would be a positive case of coronavirus in New York,” de Blasio said. “Our health authorities have been in a state of high alert for weeks, and are fully prepared to respond. We will continue to ensure New Yorkers have the facts and resources they need to protect themselves.”  Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot noted that the agency’s “disease detectives have already identified close contacts of the patient who may have been exposed and will take appropriate measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.”  “Despite this development, New Yorkers remain at low risk for contracting COVID-19,” Barbot added. “As we confront this emerging outbreak, we need to separate facts from fear, and guard against stigma and panic.”  Tests are ongoing for one other New York City patient suspected of having coronavirus.  Two patients exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus are now being tested for the illness, the city’s Health Department announced Sunday.  Until tonight, all tests of patients suspected of having coronavirus had come back negative. The previous tests were conducted by the Centers for Disease Control, and the city had to send samples from to their Atlanta headquarters. This resulted in a days-long wait for the city to learn the prognosis.  On Saturday, the city and state received approval from the federal Food and Drug Administration for their own coronavirus tests. The state tests are being conducted out of the Wadsworth Lab in Albany, and the city tests will be conducted from the Public Health Lab at NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue.  “Tests for novel #coronavirus are now being performed by @HealthNYGov’s (the state Health Department) lab, which means we will be able to get results back much sooner,” the city Health Department tweeted Sunday.

       "'When the coronavirus outbreak began in China, government officials there initially sought to deny that there was any public health issue. One doctor in Wuhan, the Chinese city hardest hit, noticed early warning signs of a potential epidemic, but was confronted by police and pressured to keep quiet. Eventually, after aggressive quarantine efforts by the government, the number of new cases in China peaked, but doubts remain as to how reliable China’s official figures are.  Now, as COVID-19, the new coronavirus that first appeared in Wuhan, spreads to other countries – including South Korea, Iran and Italy – public health officials in New York are bracing for the worst. Even though there have been no cases documented locally yet, public health officials have been open about the threat for weeks. And unlike in China, New York City’s health department has been transparent about the still small number of people who have been tested and the results of those tests.  But will it make a difference?  “It’s not a matter of if, but when, we’ll see cases of coronavirus in our city,” New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Jan. 24. “We are prepared and we need you to take precautions as well.”  While much remains unknown about the disease, whose flu-like symptoms range from resembling the common cold to life-threatening conditions, it appears to be more contagious than the related respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, infection with COVID-19 occurs through the air, in close contact of about six feet. Respiratory droplets are produced when an infected patient coughs or sneezes. These can land in the mouths or noses or are possibly inhaled into the lungs of people nearby.  Fast transmission is a particular concern in a population-dense city like New York, where infection seems more or less inevitable. “The important thing for New Yorkers to know is that in the city currently, their risk is low, and our city preparedness is high,” said New York City Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot on a Feb. 6 interview on NY1’s Inside City Hall show. “We are monitoring the situation daily to determine if our plans to protect New Yorkers need to be adjusted accordingly.”  This would not be the first time the city battles an infectious disease. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, the New York City health department implemented extensive screening procedures and training. After the death of Ebola patient Thomas Eric Duncan in Dallas, health officials in New York City set up isolation rooms in public and private hospitals. Bellevue Hospital Center was turned into the go-to facility with separate rooms with sliding glass doors, private bathrooms and a lab only for testing the blood of Ebola patients. Medical and maintenance personnel wore head-to-toe protective gear and underwent extensive drills to deter further contamination. Exercises included the proper removal of clothing, disposing of infected equipment, cleaning facilities and treating mock patients.  Hospital preparedness was put to the test when Dr. Craig Spencer tested positive for Ebola after returning from Doctors Without Borders in Guinea, marking the first case of Ebola in New York City. Spencer was immediately brought into isolation at Bellevue. The three people he came in contact with were quarantined, and the bowling alley he visited was closed and cleaned by health workers. The virus was ultimately contained, and Spencer was declared Ebola-free after less than a month.  \"It\\'s not a matter of if, but when, we\\'ll see cases of coronavirus in our city.\" - New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio  Spencer’s case “is a good indication that it can be done,” Dr. Stephen Morse, professor of epidemiology at the Columbia University Mailman School of Public Health, told City & State. “If you are careful and mindful of the fact that (infection) could happen, you make sure to look for those cases, whether it’s Ebola or the 2019 coronavirus. It’s a matter of having the right procedures and infrastructure in place and people who know how to act.”  According to Syra Madad, the senior director for the systemwide special-pathogens program for NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s health facilities are practicing basic infection control to detect COVID-19 amongst New Yorkers. “The first thing staff in the ER asks is – ‘Do you have fever, cough or rash?’” Madad told City & State. “If they do, patients are given a mask and escorted to isolation rooms right away to minimize the interaction with other patients.”  With the support of federal funding, Bellevue Hospital Center hosts in-service training to familiarize health workers with COVID-19. Medical personnel are taught how to identify cases and isolate them and undergo readiness and table-top protocols to ensure the system responds and functions properly should this outbreak worsen. “We drill all of our hospitals on what we call ‘mystery patients’ that may come in with respiratory illnesses to make sure that they are all at the same level of readiness,” a spokesperson for the New York City health department said.  On Wednesday, de Blasio asked the federal government to allow the city’s health department to test patients for the virus, arguing that it would allow the city to respond more quickly to a health emergency. Currently, the city has to rely on the CDC for testing.  If there is a surge of cases, NYC Health + Hospitals plans to address the situation from a four-S standpoint: staffing, supplies, space and system. This helps health officials ensure there are enough isolation rooms, masks and medical workers to accommodate infected patients.  While funding for the national Ebola preparedness program is set to expire early this year, individual medical systems can decide whether to continue funding the program. According to Madad, the NYC Health + Hospitals program will continue, but she voiced concern for health care programs around the nation.  “The unfortunate part is that funding was only for five years, and it actually expires in a matter of months – in 2020,” Madad told New York magazine recently. “So this entire infrastructure that we’ve built across the nation is going to get dismantled in a couple of months, which is mind-boggling knowing we’re in a potential pandemic situation and we’re letting our guard down.”  For now, travel restrictions issued by the Trump administration allow health officials to buy time and prepare for the worst. As of Feb. 2, foreign nationals who traveled to China within the past 14 days are no longer allowed to enter the United States. This does not apply to U.S. citizens who have recently been to mainland China. They are allowed to enter but may be subject to health screening and possibly 14 days of federal or self-imposed quarantine. CDC staffers evaluate travelers for fever, cough or heavy breathing, and if they show symptoms, they will be brought to a medical facility. Travelers who do not show signs of illness are allowed to complete their travel itinerary but are instructed to self-monitor their health for two weeks by staying home and avoiding contact with others.  Should cases of COVID-19 be identified in the city, officials will likely expand airport screening beyond federal guidelines and CDC requirements. During the Ebola outbreak, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and then-Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey issued a quarantine policy, ordering 21-day mandatory quarantine for all health care workers returning from Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, and traveling through John F. Kennedy and Newark Liberty International airports.  In the meantime, the city’s health officials are doing their best to promote transparency. Cuomo recently allocated $40 million to the state Health Department to hire more staff and resources to combat the disease if and when it arrives. And while China failed to notify its citizens soon enough, as The New York Times reported, here in New York both city and state health departments are updating their websites daily. “We are putting out a steady stream of press releases, website updates of suspected cases,” a spokesperson for the New York City health department said. “We are in constant communication with electeds, local health care providers and community partners to update them on the latest information.”'"

       "'Sign up for our COVID-19 newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest coronavirus news throughout New York City  Queens politicians are calling out the New York Post for using a misleading photo of Flushing Main Street, where the population is mostly Asian, to aid a story about the first case of coronavirus that was reported in Manhattan.  State Senator Toby Ann Stavisky condemned the tweet sent out by the New York Post Sunday night. The tweet used a picture of an Asian man in Flushing, while linking to an article about a coronavirus case in Manhattan.  “Posting a picture of an Asian man in Flushing, Queens, while reporting about a confirmed case in Manhattan is troubling,” Stavisky said. “This does nothing but further the misconceptions that are hurting many people and businesses in my district.”  Posting a picture of an Asian man in Flushing, Queens while reporting about a confirmed case in Manhattan is troubling. This does nothing but further the misconceptions that are hurting many people and businesses in my district. https://t.co/pakm9K2pol — Toby Ann Stavisky (@tobystavisky) March 2, 2020  On Sunday, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that a 39-year-old woman, who lives in Manhattan, contracted the virus while in Iran. According to Cuomo, the woman is currently isolated in her home, saying, “She’s not in serious condition, but does have respiratory symptoms.”  Following the use of the image from the New York Post, many Twitter users expressed anger and said the photo perpetuates fearmongering and discrimination against the Asian American community.  Councilman Peter Koo also took to Twitter, saying, “This pic is Flushing, not Manhattan. A reminder: viruses are colorblind.”  This pic is Flushing, not Manhattan. A reminder: viruses are colorblind. https://t.co/XLfLbQ3jqz — Peter Koo (@CMPeterKoo) March 2, 2020  Councilmember Barry Grodenchik said, “I appreciate the story about #Coronavirus but what is with the picture? Main St. in #Flushing is a long way from #Manhattan.”  I appreciate the story about #CoronaVirus but what is with the picture? Main St. in #Flushing is a long way from #Manhattan. https://t.co/QQTORpfR5h via @nypmetro — Barry Grodenchik (@BarryGrodenchik) March 2, 2020  Amid the coronavirus scare, Congresswoman Grace Meng, first vice chair of the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus (CAPAC), is urging other members of congress to help stop the spread of xenophobia and misinformation related to the coronavirus by only sharing confirmed and verifiable information about the illness.  This includes information on how the virus spreads and how Americans should protect themselves.  “The coronavirus is a menace to public health, and we must provide clear facts to ensure that Americans have the truth about the virus,” Meng said at a CAPAC press conference on Capitol Hill on Feb. 28. “My district in Queens has one of the largest Asian American populations in the nation, and I continue to hear about Asian-owned businesses being impacted because people are afraid to visit these establishments. Congress must demonstrate resolute leadership and the first step is to convey facts, not misinformation.”  Since the outbreak of the coronavirus, there have been a surge in reports of discrimination and violent attacks against Asian Americans across the country, according to Meng. Many of these attacks have been instigated and fueled by misinformation, including misconceptions that AAPIs are more likely to carry and spread the virus, or conspiracy theories that China created the coronavirus in a lab.'"

       "'What to Know It remains to be seen how widely COVID-19 will spread in tri-state area after 45 people in New York were confirmed to have the virus Friday, just five days after the first local case was reported  Twenty-two new cases were added to the total Friday; many of them are connected to the Westchester County lawyer who works in midtown Manhattan  New Jersey had thee positive samples that had been sent to the CDC for confirmation; Connecticut saw its first case reported Friday  UPDATE: Tri-State at 93 COVID-19 Cases and Counting  New York added 22 new coronavirus cases Friday, including four Manhattan cases and more in Westchester County, bringing the state\\'s total to 45, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio announced.  Many of the new cases are connected to the Westchester cluster that started with the midtown Manhattan lawyer, the first case of community spread. One of the new Manhattan patients is a man in his 50s who lives on the Upper West Side and is presenting mild symptoms, de Blasio said. The man is married with three daughters ages 8, 10 and 12 — all of whom also are exhibiting mild symptoms, but it wasn\\'t confirmed if they had the virus. Disease detectives are working to learn more about any close contacts he may have had while contagious.  Financial and insurance company TIAA sent a memo to employees saying that one of their employees at their offices on Lexington Avenue had tested positive for coronavirus after coming in contact with an already infected individual. That office was closed for cleaning, and would re-open on March 12.  The director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, explains social distancing and how it can help slow the spread of coronavirus in elderly and immunocompromised patients.  In Westchester, the ages of those confirmed to have the virus range from 7 to 81 years old. There were also three new cases in Nassau County, all adults, none of which were connected to the New Rochelle cases.  Of those who were found to have the coronavirus was the rabbi of Young Israel of New Rochelle, Reuven Fink, according to a statement posted Friday on the website of Yeshiva University, where Fink teaches two courses. He said he was doing \"reasonably well\" and advised anyone who had contact with him to contact their health provider as a precaution. The synagogue said on its website it will be closed through Sunday.  Overall as of Friday night, there were 35 COVID-19 cases in Westchester, four in NYC, four in Nassau County and two in Rockland County, according to Gov. Cuomo.  The three new cases in Nassau County were related to the initial case that was there, as all are part of the same family near Hempstead. The two Rockland County cases were from a man and a woman who worked at a bat mitzvah at the synagogue.  Also Friday, Cuomo delved a bit more into the state\\'s mandatory and precautionary quarantine measures. To date, 44 people statewide, including nine in New York City, are under mandatory quarantine order.  Those people have either A) Tested positive; B) Had direct contact (within 6 feet) with a person who has tested positive; C) Returned from a country with CDC travel health levels 2 or 3, the countries in the hotbed of the outbreak; or D) Is deemed in need of quarantine by a local health provider and local health department. Officials will coordinate with the state Department of Health to make that determination, the governor said.  Four thousand people across the state have self-quarantined as a precaution: 2,700 in New York City and 1,000 Westchester.  Erika Gomez, a 24-year-old English teacher from Southern California living in China has been quarantined in her studio apartment for 40 days. She shared her experience as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world.  At least two patients are currently being treated in intensive care units in Manhattan. One of the patients from Thursday, a man in his 40s, was discharged from the hospital and put into isolation at his home. The woman in her 80s was still hospitalized.  Many positive tests in the state involve people with mild symptoms — or none at all. Most of the patients remain in isolation in their homes and have not required hospitalization — as officials have said, 80 percent of people who get coronavirus self-resolve with no additional treatment necessary. Meanwhile, as of Friday, New York City was still awaiting test results for 40 people.  The city got back results for three teachers who had recently traveled to Italy. A teacher at James Madison High School in Brooklyn was negative, as were two other teachers at P.S. 369 in Brooklyn and P.S. 130 in Lower Manhattan.  In neighboring New Jersey, four people tested positive and the samples were sent to the CDC for confirmation. Those results were still pending federal confirmation as of Friday night. One is a health care worker in his 30s who works in New York City and splits time between homes there and in New Jersey, officials said. It\\'s not clear where he works or in what capacity. He\\'s doing well in isolation at the hospital, officials say. Another woman tested positive in Bergen County, and was released into isolation at her home.  Two other cases in the state were announced Friday, including a man in his 60s in southern New Jersey\\'s Camden County and a man in his 50s in Bergen County. Both have been hospitalized.  The New Jersey State Department of Health has established a 24-hour coronavirus hotline to answer questions: 800-222-1222. New York has a similar hotline set up: 888-364-3065.  Later on Friday, Connecticut saw its first case of coronavirus reported. A Fairfield County nurse was said to have COVID-19, according to Gov. Ned Lamont. The woman is a Westchester County resident, however, and is believed to have been exposed to the virus as a result of a hospital employee there. She was tested Wednesday in New York, with the positive result coming in Friday evening.  Her case marks the 35th person in Westchester County to be infected with coronavirus.  The woman is under self-quarantine at her New York home, but she may have come in contact with patients and staff at Danbury Hospital and Norwalk Hospital, where she worked. Officials are trying to find those she may have come into contact with, and any hospital employees she had contact with were placed on a 14-day furlough.  Some schools in the state were closing as another case of COVID-19 was found in New Jersey, with cases now in Bergen and Camden counties. NBC New York’s Brian Thompson reports.  Renee Coleman-Mitchell, the commissioner of Connecticut\\'s Department of Public Health, said the case does not officially count as a Connecticut case. No state residents of Connecticut have yet tested positive for coronavirus.  Connecticut also has more than 200 people self-monitoring for symptoms of COVID-19. Gov. Lamont announced that he was asking the CDC to send more testing kits so the state could comply with updated federal guidance on who should be tested.  Worldwide, the virus has infected more than 100,000 people and killed over 3,400. New York officials have sought to emphasize that most cases are mild and the overall risk to the general public is quite low.  Still, cases of the new virus — and concerns about potential new ones — have already prompted officials to ask thousands of people in recent weeks to quarantine themselves. A few schools and college campuses have closed for cleaning. Community events have been canceled out of an abundance of caution. Local governments are implementing changes -- some major, some minor -- that may impact the daily lives of people who will never get COVID-19. Here\\'s a breakdown of what\\'s happening in that regard by state.  De Blasio also urged the CDC to supply New York with more test kits and to speed the approval of tests that private companies may be developing.  The state got approval Saturday to run its own version of the test. Cuomo said Thursday the state is now able to run about 100 to 200 tests a day and is now working with other laboratories to boost testing capacity.  Health officials are looking at two probable cases of coronavirus in New Jersey. Brian Thompson reports.  New York City, meanwhile, got a new batch of CDC test kits. De Blasio said Thursday that the city ultimately wants the capacity to do hundreds of tests per day or more and needs federal help to get there. Authorities also caution that increased testing will lead to more positive cases by default.  How to Protect Yourself  New York City\\'s Health Department released the following guidance for people who recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea -- or for anyone who experiences fever, cough or shortness of breath:  Stay home — do not travel or go to work or school while sick  Go to a health care provider and tell them about your travel history If you do not have a health care provider or insurance, call 311  Avoid contact with others  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available  Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands  Nationally, the CDC said that as of Friday it had a total of 164 cases reported by 19 states; in the vast majority of those cases, authorities aren\\'t yet sure how the virus was contracted. Eleven people have died, all of them from Washington state except for one, who was from California.  The CDC only updates its numbers once a weekday, though, and the numbers reflect the agency\\'s total as of 4 p.m. the previous day. The case total in the United States could be higher. NBC News reported it as being up to 258 cases nationwide as of Friday afternoon.  CDC officials warned for weeks to expect a disruptive spread of the virus in America. Here\\'s where we stand now as far as developing a vaccine.  On Friday, President Trump signed an $8.3 billion measure to fuel national efforts to combat the spread. The legislation provides sustenance for a multifaceted attack -- money for vaccines, tests, potential treatments and to help local governments respond -- on the virus.'"

       "'What to Know It remains to be seen how widely COVID-19 will spread in tri-state area after 22 people in New York were confirmed to have the virus Thursday, just four days after the first local case was reported  Two new NYC cases were confirmed Thursday, both patients in intensive care; cases have no known connection to travel or other local COVID-19 cases, marking fresh instance of community spread  A New Jersey man in his 30s is a presumptive positive, sources say; he allegedly got it from one of the patients in New York. The state announced a second presumptive case on Thursday  New Directives? What\\'s Mandatory? How Tri-State COVID-19 Action May Affect Your Daily Life  Two more people in the city have tested positive for coronavirus and are hospitalized in an intensive care unit and more cases have been confirmed elsewhere in the state, including the first on Long Island, bringing New York\\'s total to 22 cases, Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio said.  Most of the new cases announced Thursday were in Westchester County and are tied to the midtown Manhattan lawyer whose case marked the state\\'s first instance of community spread, Cuomo said.  The number of new coronavirus cases rose to 22 in New York, with the vast majority of cases in New Rochelle in Westchester County. NBC New York’s Ida Siegal reports.  The Long Island patient is a 42-year-old man from Nassau County who is hospitalized and, according to Cuomo, had \"underlying medical conditions.\" Officials said the man is from the Hempstead suburb of Uniondale.  NYU Winthrop Hospital confirmed the man was in isolation while receiving treatment, and his condition was improving. Officials believe that the case was community spread, with the source of the infection unknown.  Neither new New York City case — a man in his 40s and a woman in her 80s — has a known connection to travel or any previously diagnosed local COVID-19 patients, marking what appears to be fresh community spread in the five boroughs, de Blasio said. Both of them had underlying respiratory conditions that have exacerbated their symptoms — the man, vaping and smoking — the woman, age-related issues, the mayor said.  City disease detectives are tracing close contacts of both new patients and will ensure they are isolated and tested. Later on Thursday, retail clothing giant Gap said in a statement to CNBC that an employee at their New York City headquarters was confirmed to have the virus. The individual was not in the office on Thursday, and it was not immediately clear if their employee was one of the new cases reported by officials or a separate instance. Gap\\'s Tribeca headquarters will now be closed indefinitely.  \"The community spread dynamic is unpredictable and worrisome, so we\\'re watching carefully ... our level of concern is rising for sure,\" de Blasio said later Thursday. \"That said, the big picture point, that we know for sure is 80 percent of the folks who get it have very mild symptoms.\"  Erika Gomez, a 24-year-old English teacher from Southern California living in China has been quarantined in her studio apartment for 40 days. She shared her experience as the coronavirus continues to spread around the world.  The mayor also announced a new order from the health commissioner Thursday -- one that applies to city workers, specifically first responders, health care workers and educators. It operates on a case-by-case basis. If the commissioner determines someone is at risk for coronavirus that person can be required to get a COVID-19 test.  Contact investigators are also tracing anyone who may have had contact with the Long Island patient. Identified close contacts have already been isolated, according to Nassau County officials.  The patient is a man from Nassau County in his 40s with an underlying medical condition, but he is said to be improving. Officials say he contracted the virus through the community. NBC New York’s Greg Cergol reports.  De Blasio said he expected that any of those city workers who traveled to outbreak affected areas and also had symptoms would be required to undergo testing. Refusal to be tested will results in a mandatory quarantine order and employment consequences, the mayor added.  As for the rest of New Yorkers, anyone who has recently returned from China, Iran, Italy, South Korea or Japan is asked to isolated for 14 days.  Two schools in Manhattan announced that they will be closed on Friday, amid the spread of COVID-19 cases. The Spence School on the Upper East Side said on its website that it will be closed for a \"comprehensive sanitization of the entire campus.\" On the other side of the island, Upper West Side\\'s Collegiate School said on its website that it will be closed as well, but did not provide a reason. There have been no confirmed cases tied to either school, and the cleaning appears to be out of an abundance of caution.  Three teachers in New York City who had traveled to Italy have been tested for coronavirus. Test results for a teacher who works at James Madison High School in Brooklyn came back negative, but the other two were still pending. Officials said the teachers were in class for one day before they self-quarantined at home.  Other precautions in area include a Yonkers skating rink closing after potential exposure to COVID-19. E.J. Murray\\'s Skating Rink would be closed out of an abundance of caution, mayor Mike Spano said, as there was \"no evidence\" any patrons were exposed to the virus.  The developments come amid an apparent surge of positive cases due to increased in-state and in-city testing — and while officials continue to tell people not to panic and that 80 percent of people who get it self-resolve, many are concerned about protecting themselves and their families.  It remains to be seen how widely COVID-19 will spread in tri-state area after 22 people in New York were confirmed to have the virus Thursday, just four days after the first local case was reported. Rana Novini reports.  That concern is only growing as more cases pop-up where \"superspreaders\" apparently passed the disease to others. The Westchester attorney who had an underlying respiratory illness, and was hospitalized in the state\\'s first case of person-to-person spread, apparently passed it on to his neighbor and family, who passed it on to a friend\\'s family -- and, possibly, others.  In New Jersey, a 32-year-old man tested positive for novel coronavirus but officials are awaiting a confirmed positive from the CDC, the mayor of Fort Lee said in an update statement Thursday. Acting Gov. Shiela Oliver announced a second presumptive case Thursday afternoon.  Sources tell NBC New York that the Fort Lee man had contact with one of the New York patients; the man was said to be resting comfortably at a hospital and doing well as of Thursday morning.  The New Jersey State Department of Health has established a 24-hour coronavirus hotline to answer questions: 800-222-1222. New York has a similar hotline set up: 888-364-3065.  The sources didn\\'t identify the New York connection to the Fort Lee man; at the time he was reported to have COVID-19, though, the only confirmed tri-state case not linked to the Westchester attorney was the Manhattan health care worker who traveled to Iran, the state\\'s first confirmed case.  Her husband tested negative but is still being quarantined as a precaution, officials said.  On Thursday, the second presumptive positive case in the Garden State was a person in North Jersey, the Department of Health commissioner said. That patient was being treated at Englewood Hospital.  That first coronavirus case in the tri-state came Sunday night. Two days later, news broke of the Westchester attorney — and the following positive cases came in rapid succession, largely due in part to the state and city\\'s ability to test people quickly and disease detectives\\' efforts to track contacts.  It\\'s still not clear how that Westchester man contracted the infection in the first place. He had no known travel to countries most affected by the outbreak and was considered to be the first person-to-person spread case.  That case touched off a flurry of precautionary testing and more confirmed positives. The attorney\\'s 20-year-old son, 14-year-old daughter and wife, who works at his same law firm, all tested positive; the son was the only one to actually show symptoms. He attended Yeshiva University, which has been closed pending investigation since the news broke.  The daughter attended SAR Academy and High School in the Bronx. The family belonged to a synagogue. A New York Law School student reported prior contact with the attorney. The Health Department has been in touch with all connected facilities and communities and is providing continued guidance accordingly.  Other schools have been taking precautionary measures as well. The school district in Hastings-on-Hudson said it would close this week “out of an abundance of caution” because a parent had been in contact with a person under quarantine. Mount Vernon City School District said Wednesday that schools would close until Monday so cleaning crews can disinfect buildings.  In the city, De Blasio said public school trips to high risk-designated countries have been canceled. He noted there has been no noticeable change in city public school attendance and released a thorough accounting of how key city agencies, including the Department of Education, are handling COVID-19 preparation and response.  New York City agencies are prepared for COVID-19. Here\\'s a breakdown of our citywide response, beginning with @nycHealthy pic.twitter.com/5VB8nbh42k — City of New York (@nycgov) March 4, 2020  Amid the calls for calm, there has been a rush for supplies. On Wednesday, the city declared face masks to be temporarily in short supply, triggering consumer protection rules that make it illegal for stores to price gouge.  The general public doesn\\'t need to rush to buy them, though. De Blasio clarified Wednesday that there are only two reasons to wear masks: 1) If you have the virus, it will help reduce the spread, or 2) if you\\'re a health care professional working with people who have the virus.  Wearing masks \"is not a general prophylactic for everyday people trying to ward off the disease,\" the mayor said.  .@NYCMayor updates New Yorkers on COVID-19 and proper mask usage at City Hall earlier today: pic.twitter.com/RKaGk3jrt9 — NYC Mayor\\'s Office (@NYCMayorsOffice) March 5, 2020  The rise in cases has sparked concern about public transportation as well. New York officials have said the woman who first tested positive did not use mass transit after flying back to the States from Iran early last week. They have not said either way whether other patients had used mass transit while potentially contagious, but the MTA has engaged in a robust prevention and cleaning plan as part of the city\\'s overall preparedness and response efforts. More details on what the MTA is doing about coronavirus here.  Taxi regulators are telling drivers and owners to clean their cars with disinfectant products at least once a day, paying special attention to surfaces that are touched often, such as door handles, armrests, and seat belts. Uber said it has similar protocols in place.  The Metropolitan Transportation says it has enhanced its daily cleaning procedures of all stations, train cars and buses in an effort to prevent the spread of COVID-19. So far, one person in New York City has been confirmed with the virus but the woman has not taken used public transport since she got back from Iran, officials said. NBC New York\\'s Anjali Hemphill reports.  Gov. Andrew Cuomo continues to reiterate his early calls to remain calm. As he has in recent days, the governor sought Wednesday to reassure the public that the disease is often passed by close contact, not casual contact like riding in the same subway car as a person who may be sick.  “We have an epidemic caused by coronavirus,\" Cuomo said. “But we have a pandemic that is caused by fear.”  Previously, the governor announced a new directive requiring New York health insurers to waive cost-sharing associated with coronavirus testing, including emergency room, urgent care and office visits.  \"We can\\'t let cost be a barrier to access to COVID-19 testing for any New Yorker,\" Cuomo said.  How to Protect Yourself  New York City\\'s Health Department released the following guidance for people who recently traveled to China, Iran, Italy, Japan or South Korea -- or for anyone who experiences fever, cough or shortness of breath:  Stay home — do not travel or go to work or school while sick  Go to a health care provider and tell them about your travel history If you do not have a health care provider or insurance, call 311  Avoid contact with others  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available  Avoid touching your face with unwashed hands  Nationally, the CDC said that as of Thursday it had a total of 100 cases reported by 13 states; only about a third of those have been confirmed to be related to travel. Eleven people have died, all of them from Washington state except for the newest victim, whose death was reported by California.  The CDC only updates its numbers once a weekday, though, and the numbers reflect the agency\\'s total as of 4 p.m. the previous day. The case total in the United States could be higher. NBC News reported it as being up to 212 cases nationwide as of Thursday afternoon.  CDC officials warned for weeks to expect a disruptive spread of the virus in America. They say they have enough kits to test more than 75,000 people right now -- and de Blasio said Thursday the city \"urgently\" needs the CDC to increase its supply of COVID-19 test kits. He also said the agency needs to expedite approval of any testing approaches currently being developed by private companies. Here\\'s where stand now as far as developing a vaccine.  De Blasio said Thursday that the city\\'s biggest challenge is not being able to test even more people: \"Our single greatest challenge is the lack of fast federal action to increase testing capacity -- without that, we cannot beat this epidemic back.\"  The Senate overwhelmingly passed an $8.3 billion measure Thursday -- by a vote of 96 to 1 -- as part of national efforts to help combat the spread. The bill now goes to the White House for President Trump\\'s signature. The money would pay for a multifaceted attack on that virus that has already infected nearly 100,000 people and killed more than 3,000 across the globe.  As the viral infections spread across the globe, everybody has to make a decision: How worried should I be about getting infected, and what should I do about it?'"

       "'Sign up for our COVID-19 newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest coronavirus news throughout New York City  The sixth and seventh suspected coronavirus cases in New York City came back negative, the city’s Health Department reported Wednesday.  Despite grave concerns about the spread of the virus which originated in China weeks ago, every single suspected case reported in the city turned out to be false alarms. The Centers for Disease Control tested samples collected from patients in New York City and found that all of them were not infected.  “All negative for novel #coronavirus in NYC!” the Health Department celebrated in a Feb. 12 tweet. “@CDCgov has confirmed that the 7th person tested in the city has come back negative. We now have zero cases pending.”  Though the news has been good in New York City, concern about coronavirus remains high across the world. The city rolled out last month a proactive plan designed to contain the spread of the bug while also providing the best care possible to anyone who might become infected.  Panic set in across the city on Feb. 1 when NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue reported a patient exhibiting symptoms of coronavirus, such as fever, cough and/or shortness of breath. The next day, two more individuals hospitalized in Queens shared the same symptoms.  All three patients had told physicians that they recently visited China, where the outbreak began. Yet all three, and four others thought to be infected this month, were ultimately cleared following CDC testing.  Even so, fears and misinformation about coronavirus caused a downturn in activity in Chinatown and other neighborhoods across the city with large Chinese populations. Officials have gone out of their way to tell the public there’s nothing to fear visiting and shopping in the communities.  The Health Department reminds the public to follow the same precautions normally taken during cold and flu season:  Cover your nose and mouth with a tissue or sleeve when sneezing or coughing.  Wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water aren’t available.  Stay home if you don’t feel well.  Seek medical care if you exhibit flu/coronavirus symptoms, and alert your health care provider if you’ve recently traveled to the Hubei province in China.  Get a flu shot if you haven’t already done so.  More information on the coronavirus can be found on the Health Department’s website.'"

       "'Sign up for our COVID-19 newsletter to stay up-to-date on the latest coronavirus news throughout New York City  The city Department of Health identified a sixth person to be tested for the potentially fatal coronavirus on Saturday, just as they clear five cases that had worried New Yorkers for the past week.  The sixth person, unidentified and who’s origin in the city was also not given, was tested on Saturday – and the agency expects testing results from the Centers for Disease Control as soon as Tuesday.  The first of the suspected cases was reported on Jan. 31 after a woman under 40 checked into Bellevue Hospital after returning from a trip to China. Out of an “abundance of caution” the hospital quarantined her until the results by the CDC lab could be released.  Four other cases were also reported, two in Queens, and two others not identified. All were tested and three of the four were residents of New York City, and one other from out-of-town. All four were found to be negative for the virus.  Officials have said there are numerous types of viruses going around this winter, in addition to the flu. Health officials urge residents to get the flu shot, which killed thousands each year nation-wide.  The city has appealed to the CDC to supply test kits to be performed here in New York City. The CDC announced this past week that they are preparing the kits to be sent to major cities across the country. There are 12 confirmed coronavirus cases in six states including six in California at this time. In China, where the virus began in Wuhan Province, thousands have been infected and more than 1,000 people have died.  Over the weekend, nearly 20,000 people attended the Chinatown Lunar New Year Parade where some feared the virus might impact turnout. Instead, the streets were filled with people amid colorful dragons and pageantry.  Elected officials have expressed dismay that some people have become biased against Chinese Americans and all have said racism “will not be tolerated,” even as no cases of coronavirus have been yet identified in the city.  “This is exactly what we prepared for and is evidence that the system in place is working as it should,” said Health Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot. “We are fortunate that the test results from our first person under investigation came back negative, but we expect to see more people presenting to health care facilities with symptoms of the novel coronavirus.”  This coronavirus can lead to symptoms of fever, cough or shortness of breath. While some infections have resulted in severe illness, and even death, others have presented with milder symptoms and been discharged from care, health officials said.  The Health Department is continuing to monitor the evolving worldwide situation daily, including the latest data on transmissions, incubation, new cases, and guidance. The Department has distributed educational materials so that people have the facts about how to protect themselves and their families from coronavirus and other respiratory illnesses, what to do if they feel unwell and have a travel history to affected areas, and other important information about this disease.  The Health Department has conducted outreach and is providing guidance to local community-based organizations and health care providers serving our communities to inform them of the necessary precautions they need to take if someone with symptoms of coronavirus visits them.  Health officials say those who feel sick with fever, cough, or difficulty breathing, and traveled to Hubei Province China—or been in contact with a confirmed case the novel coronavirus — within 14 days of symptom onset:  Seek medical care right away. Before going to a doctor’s office or emergency room, call ahead and tell them about recent travel and symptoms.  Avoid contact with others.  Do not travel while sick.  Cover mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve (not hands) when coughing or sneezing.  Wash hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available.  For more information about the coronavirus, visit the Heath Department website at nyc.gov/health.'"

       "'The noodles are pulled by hand, the food is hot, and the workers are ready to serve the dishes at Chinese restaurants in Flushing.  But the customers are nowhere to be found.  That\\'s because of the fear stemming from the Wuhan coronavirus that has swept through the region. Despite no cases having been found anywhere in the tri-state as the illness spreads, many are apparently hesitant to go in certain areas — like Chinatown sections in Queens and Manhattan.  The teens responsible dressed in Hazmat outfits and spilled a container said to be the coronavirus — when really it was just Kool-Aid and soap. The MTA and some riders aren\\'t laughing, however. NBC New York’s Ken Buffa reports.  And that fear is driving down business for local eateries. Jian Lin, the manager of Lanzhou Noodle at the New World Mall food court, said he is seeing about half as many customers as before the virus outbreak. Chen Long, who owns Heat Noodle in the same food court, said its about a 60 percent drop off for his business.  \"I understand, but I also want to tell people it’s okay because there’s no one with the virus in New York,\" said Long, who is from Wuhan — the epicenter of the illness.  Video shows the woman initially running after a man, who then turned back and started attacking her, while allegedly calling her \"diseased.\" NBC New York’s Ida Siegal reports.  Usually, the lunch hour means the food court where their restaurants are would be packed. But tourists are avoiding the Chinatown hotspots, and even locals are more apt to stay home recently over their concerns that New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said \"are not based on fact or based on science.\"  In an effort to get more people coming back to the eateries, Queens Chamber of Commerce President Thomas Grech wanted to show that the neighborhood is \"open for business.\" Other political leaders in the city, including Mayor de Blasio, had lunch at Royal Queen restaurant on Thursday to show it\\'s safe to eat there.  \"Everyone should be coming to Flushing. They should be coming to Chinatown. They should be coming to Sunset Park,\" said Johnson. \"They should be going to neighborhoods and restaurants that have some of the finest food in New York.”  My secret is out!    Can I use chopsticks?  No.    Will I keep trying anyway?  Yes.    Should all of you head out to our city’s MANY Asian-American owned restaurants this weekend for a bite to eat?  HECK yes. https://t.co/fBfrhOzFKj — Mayor Bill de Blasio (@NYCMayor) February 14, 2020  Medical officials with the city are urging people to go about their normal lives as well. \"We want to reassure everyone that New Yorkers should go about their every day business as usual,\" said Dr. Raul Perea-Henze, the Deputy Mayor for Health and Human Services.  Doctors in the tri-state and the U.S. say that the flu is still a much bigger concern than the coronavirus. With the exception of anyone who has been to Wuhan recently, chances of catching the illness are extremely low.'"

       "'By Jonathan Sperling  Test results came back negative for two people being treated for suspected coronavirus at Flushing hospitals Thursday, two days after the city’s Health Department first started monitoring them.  The unidentified patients, who had both recently traveled to mainland China, were being treated at Flushing Hospital Medical Center and Flushing’s New York-Presbyterian Queens. Both patients are over the age of 60 and reported a fever and cough or shortness of breath without another common cause, like the flu and other cold viruses, the Health Department said last week.  Testing by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention took approximately 48 hours and determined that both patients were negative for the coronavirus, the Health Department said on Twitter Thursday.  More than 31,000 cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in China and more than 600 deaths have occurred as a result as of Friday. In the United States, there were 12 confirmed cases of coronavirus as of Wednesday, though dozens of cases were still pending testing.  NYC Health Department Commissioner Dr. Oxiris Barbot has repeatedly assured residents that the agency is working closely with the CDC and federal government as the outbreak continues.  “If you have traveled to the area affected by the outbreak in the last 14 days and feel unwell, call your doctor or visit a clinic, and you will be cared for,” Barbot said in a statement.  The first individual identified for testing for the novel coronavirus in New York City was a 40-year-old woman admitted to Bellevue Medical Center in stable condition on Feb. 1. Her case had eventually been confirmed negative.  Two additional patients in New York City were under investigation for coronavirus as of press time Friday.'"

       "'Chinatown leaders and shop owners are begging New Yorkers to patronize their restaurants and shops after a weeks-long lull in business that they blamed on unwarranted fears about the new coronavirus outbreak.  There have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in New York City as well as the state, and only one case in the entire Northeast. Nonetheless, Chinatowns across the city have seen a significant decline in business.  “There’s a lot of cancellations. We know the foot traffic is down,” said Wellington Chen, the executive director of the Chinatown Partnership, during a Wednesday press conference.  Listen to Richard Yeh discuss his visit to Flushing with Jami Floyd on WNYC’s All Things Considered:  Chen said that in addition to talking to business owners, the partnership had also identified a decrease in trash collected in the smart garbage cans that line Canal Street.  “Across the board, from grocery to banquet hall, everyone we talk to, there’s no one who says, ‘I haven’t suffered,\\'\" he said, adding, \"It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that this drop is severe.”  Travel restrictions have especially put a damper on visits from Chinese tourists.  “My business dropped about 60-70 percent,\" said Chi Vy Ngo, the owner of New York Bo Ky Restaurant on Bayard Street. He said survival of businesses like his \"depends on the public,\" adding, \"Come out show more support and this thing will go away very soon.”  Mohammed Shariful Islam, 35, who works at a souvenir shop on Mott Street, said he also noticed a dip in traffic and sales. January is usually a slow month, he added, but this one has been particularly bad, with daily receipts dropping between $600 to $1,000.  arrow Wellington Chen of the Chinatown Partnership holds a press conference to talk about the impact of the virus on businesses. Gwynne Hogan / WNYC  The latest coronavirus has sickened more than 40,000 people and caused more than 1,000 deaths, mostly in China\\'s Hubei province. Across the United States, just 13 people have tested positive for the novel coronavirus. An additional 60 cases are pending, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The flu, on the other hand, has sickened at least 89,597 New Yorkers so far this season, and killed at least three children. However, the flu only has an estimated death rate of 1 percent, compared to around 3 percent for the coronavirus.  Businesses in Flushing’s Chinatown have also been hit especially hard. Last Saturday evening, a popular dinner spot Szechuan Mountain House, which is normally packed to the gills through midnight, emptied out by 10 p.m.  Cheong Tak Chio, an acupuncturist and doctor of Chinese medicine who is the head of the Hubei Association, has run his practice in Flushing for the last 20 years. He told Gothamist/WNYC that he saw a drop in appointments beginning around the Lunar New Year.  Still, he said he was optimistic that things are turning around.  “It feels like it’s getting better. The community is rebounding,” Cheong said in Mandarin. “Now that everyone’s learning more about the outbreak and realizing that it’s not so bad, now you begin to see crowds return. I think give it another week, and Flushing could be 80-90 percent back.\"  Chen Long, the owner of Heat Noodle, a restaurant located in the normally bustling food court in the basement of the New World Mall, specializes in the cuisine of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak. A Wuhan native, he estimated he’d lost half his business since the outbreak started in late December. But he said he wasn’t too concerned.  “Worry doesn\\'t help, so I just do what I do as usual,” he said. “Try to make my food delicious.”'"

       "'Businesses in the usually busy neighborhood are cutting staff as sales drop even though the virus has not yet made it to New York City  New York City’s Chinatown is typically a bustling hub for locals and tourists alike, an economic center fueled by hundreds of independent shops selling everything from cellphones to steaming plates of shu mai.  But recently, the streets of Chinatown’s corner of downtown Manhattan have been quieter. Fewer tour groups are walking along the streets, fewer people are going to the neighborhood’s most famous restaurants. Even some locals seem hesitant to go out to their favorite spots.  Though Wuhan is nearly 7,500 miles (12,000km) from New York City, and there have been no confirmed cases of the coronavirus in the city or state of New York, Chinatown business owners say their restaurant and shops are taking hits over fears of the virus.  “We laid off about 40% of our staff to maintain the business because we’re getting less profit,” said David Ching, owner of Yin Ji Chang Fen, the sole New York outlet of a popular rice noodle roll chain in Guangzhou, China.  Though the restaurant was packed to the brim with customers when it opened in September, the number of patrons dropped off by about 40% once news of the virus spread, Ching said.  Before the typical lunch rush, Yin Ji Chang Fen had just a few tables open on Wednesday morning. But Ching said it was about half of what they would usually get before fears over the virus started. “It’s been slow,” he said.  Just down the street from Yin Ji Chang Fen, Julia Chang was the sole waitress taking orders at Julia Tea & Dim Sum House, the restaurant that bears her name. Business has been down by about 20%, forcing her and her co-owners to cut staff.  “Before we put a notice for hiring [on the window], and now I have to take it off,” Chang said. “People may be scared to come to Chinatown – it’s understandable.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest A woman walks in Chinatown on 13 February. Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP  Though they declined to speak on the record since their managers were not in at the time, multiple employees at restaurants throughout New York’s Chinatown said coronavirus fears has resulted in a noticeable decline in business. “It’s one word: terrible,” one employee at a restaurant said.  The decline in business in Chinatown coincides with an uptick in xenophobic attacks against people of Asian descent around the world. In Los Angeles, a woman said a man directed a rant about the coronavirus toward her. “I’m not even Chinese … He’s really attacking me because I look a certain way.”  Though Chinatown is most known for its dining spots, other types of businesses have taken hits. Gina Ma, owner of a souvenir and gift shop said that, while the winter months are typically slower, only one or two customers are stopping in around lunchtime.  “On our customers’ side, we definitely understand certain parts. We cannot blame [them], but it hurts right now.”  Ma noted that people who come in the store are often wearing masks, and she’s scared that even a sneeze from a cold or allergy would turn people away. “People think it’s the Chinese … We’re living here in America, but people think that Chinatown has lots of Chinese, so they’re scared.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Frankie Chu, owner of Vegetarian Dim Sum House in Chinatown, sits in his empty restaurant on 13 February. Photograph: Bebeto Matthews/AP  In response to the stigma the virus created around visiting Chinatown, local groups and elected officials in New York City have started a campaign called Show Some Love for Chinatown to attract support for local businesses.  “There is concern about the cumulative effect on this community. It’s like a boxer, how many blows can you take before you go under?” said Wellington Chen, executive director of the Chinatown Partnership Local Development Corporation, which helped to coordinate the campaign. “The ultimate answer lies with public support. It is so important.”  In other cities in the US, elected officials have made it a point to have lunch in their local Chinatown, reaffirming that fears of visiting the neighborhood are unfounded. “Chinatown is safe. The city is safe. America is safe. Everybody should relax,” said Kenney, Philadelphia’s mayor, at a dim sum restaurant in the city’s Chinatown district.

Photograph: Yana Paskova/Reuters  There have been 15 confirmed cases of coronavirus in the US in seven states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The number of confirmed cases worldwide has exceeded 75,000, with the vast majority of cases concentrated in mainland China.  Earlier this month, US officials said they evacuated 195 Americans from Wuhan, all of whom would be placed under a 14-day quarantine at an air reserve based in California. A temporary travel restriction was also put on foreign nationals who travelled to China. US citizens who recently traveled to China faced screening at and are required to undertake 14 days of self-screening.  Chinese people in UK targeted with abuse over coronavirus Read more  Chen has spent the last few weeks trying to assuage the public that fears over coronavirus are unfounded since the virus has not yet made it to New York City.  “Someone asked very sincerely: ‘In the fish store next door, is the fish safe to eat?’ That fish is not from China, that fish is from our local Atlantic Ocean,” Chen said. “It’s generally that degree of unnecessary fear.”  Chen said that he remains hopeful that people will start to realize they have nothing to worry about when visiting New York City’s Chinatown.  “We just believe that you should have no fear because it’s thousands of miles away,” Chen said. “The biggest fear you should have is whether you have room for dessert.”'"

       "\"This scanning electron microscope image shows the virus that causes novel coronavirus (COVID-19), isolated from a patient in the U.S., emerging from the surface of cells (blue/pink). Photo: NIAID-RML  It’s only a matter of time before the novel coronavirus (COVID-19) breaks out in New York City, according to officials and the city Health Department. Is the city’s health care system ready?  That depends in part on hospitals’ “surge capacity” — the ability to handle 20-25 percent more patients than usual.  National policy calls for hospitals to accommodate surges of 500 new patients per million population in a disaster. That would amount to 4,300 additional patients across New York City. Based on population, Brooklyn would need to handle about 1,250 additional patients during a surge, and there could be two or three surges during an outbreak.  DAILY TOP BROOKLYN NEWS News for those who live, work and play in Brooklyn and beyond Leave this field empty if you're human:  It also depends on the city’s ability to coordinate the responses of hospitals, agencies and the state and federal government. During biological outbreaks, the New York City Department of Health is considered the “primary agency” under the Citywide Incident Management System, and takes on coordination responsibility.  Increasing surge capacity means hospitals have to empty rooms currently being used for less seriously ill patients (in a process called Rapid Patient Discharge) and utilize unused spaces. During Superstorm Sandy, for example, some receiving hospitals turned lobbies into inpatient wards.  Hospitals must also create rooms fitted out especially for children. (A 2010 study found that few hospitals with pediatric intensive care units had detailed surge capacity plans.)  Hospitals have to muster extra staff, stockpile protective gear, equipment and medicines, and arrange myriad details — like contracting with linen companies for extra sheets and towels. The city must coordinate with state and federal authorities, and may need to acquire medicine from the Strategic National Stockpile.  -->  In the New York area, Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst in New Jersey and Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn have been designated as potential emergency camps to quarantine people with possible exposure.  Sen. Chuck Schumer said last week that New York City could be faced with expenses of roughly a million dollars a day to pay for the Department of Health’s prevention and surveillance activities, doctors, nurses, security and overtime, along with diagnostic and lab testing, equipment, supplies, gear, and additional security assistance from the NYPD.  Likely to stress the system  So far, all suspected cases of coronavirus in New York City have been ruled negative. But as Mayor Bill de Blasio said at a press conference in January, it’s not a question of if, it’s a question of when.  Panelists testifying before the Senate’s Homeland Security subcommittee on Friday spoke urgently about the country’s surge capacity.  “We have to look and see what’s happening in these other countries and assume the same thing is going to happen here,” Dr. Asha George, executive director of the Bipartisan Commission on Biodefense, said. “I think we have to plan for the possibility that we have thousands of cases. Or hundreds of thousands.”  Dr. Luciana Boreo, vice president at In-Q-Tel and former director for medical and biodefense preparedness at the National Security Council, told the panel, “It’s pretty clear that [coronavirus is] likely to severely stress our health care systems because of the lack of surge capacity we have today to treat a large influx of patients with acute and serious respiratory diseases.”  Dr. Scott Gottlieb, former Commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration, told the Senate panel that the odds are high that cases are already going undetected in the U.S.  “Some of the modeling out of the U.K. suggests we’re capturing about 25 percent of the cases at best,” he said. “At least some of these cases are probably propagating virus at a local level.”  ‘Staffing, supplies, space and system’  NYC Health + Hospitals, the city’s public health care system, says surge capacity preparations include the four S’s: staffing, supplies, space and system.  “NYC Health + Hospitals regularly prepares and drills for all hazards, including special pathogens such as the coronavirus,” the agency’s spokesperson Christopher Miller told the Brooklyn Eagle.  “Any time there is a potential for a surge, we revisit our existing plans to ensure that we can triage and accommodate patients should we receive a high volume of potential or confirmed cases,” he said.  New York City’s private hospitals and clinics have also been preparing.  Dr. Reed Caldwell, chief of service at NYU Langone Cobble Hill Emergency Department, told the Eagle that NYU has carried out an “enterprise-wide table top drill and [has] been doing daily site-specific preparations.”  “Interdisciplinary teams have developed plans to expand capacity within each of our facilities” and are working with senior leadership and NYU’s emergency management team to assess the need for staffing, Caldwell said.  NYU Langone “works closely with city, state and federal agencies to plan for this and all kinds of emergencies,” he added.  Some of New York City’s hospitals have been participating in joint drills, such as the recent SurgeEx 2020. This state-level drill included 55 hospitals, 17 nursing homes and multiple state agencies. During the drill, seven hospitals were designated as “evacuating” facilities (including Bellevue in Manhattan) and nine were selected as “receiving” facilities (including SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn).  Worst case: tens of thousands of bodies  In a pandemic, the office of the city’s Chief Medical Examiner has estimated it might have to handle two to three surges, with each surge lasting roughly eight weeks.  In its detailed pandemic plan for a severe influenza outbreak drawn up by the Medical Examiner’s Office, death rates were estimated to range from 1.1 percent to 3.5 percent, leading to a potential for 27,000 to 86,000 victims over an eight-week period. Numbers released by the Chinese Centers for Disease Control on February 17 calculate the overall coronavirus mortality rate in China is 2.3 percent. The rate is lower for the young and higher among older age groups.  The agency will “recover, process and hold decedents from residential and healthcare facility locations until private sector entities are able to manage final disposition,” the plan says. If the decedents’ family members are also sick, the agency may have to store the bodies in refrigerated trucks until someone can deal with them. Since supplies such as body bags are stocked using a just-in-time inventory system, the agency could run short.  Supply chain could become a problem  NYC Health + Hospitals says it is in regular contact with suppliers to ensure that their medical equipment and medicine supply chain remains uninterrupted.  NYU Langone also says it’s ready, as far as masks, gowns, equipment and medications are concerned. “We have evaluated our stock and are well prepared,” Caldwell told the Eagle.  But in the long run, obtaining supplies and medicine could be a problem.  The FDA has estimated that about 80 percent of active drug ingredients are manufactured overseas, many in China.  Dr. Gottlieb told the Senate panel on Friday that China is the sole source of many medications and medical supplies essential to Americans. Wuhan, where the virus broke out, is a global center of production for pharmaceutical ingredients.  “We’ve identified a critical choke point for critical pharmaceuticals,” Gottlieb said. “It calls into question disruptions in the supply chain.”  Dr. Julie Gerberding, chief patient officer at Merck, co-chair of the Commission on Global Health Security and former CDC director, told senators on Friday that the U.S. has a strategic national stockpile, “an enormous reservoir of medical equipment, supplies, medicines, vaccines, etc. strategically situated around our country.  “That is our first line of defense,” Gerberding said. “The stockpile is not limitless, and the supply chains for replenishing it will be very marginal at best, so I don’t think it’s a solution, but it will definitely help us buy some time.”  As of Friday, there were 47,505 laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 cases in China, according to the World Health Organization. There have been 1,381 deaths in China, including 121 reported on Friday. Outside China, there have been 505 cases in 24 countries and two deaths. 1716 Chinese health workers have been infected, and six have died.  ________  Updated on Feb. 18 with figures from China’s CDC showing a coronavirus mortality rate of 2.3 percent.  Updated on Feb. 18 with information about coronavirus-related expenses to the city.\""

       "'*Correction appended  Tuesday’s biggest developments  Texas reports 3,266 cases and 41 deaths  Paxton gets temporary victory on abortion ban  Harris County extends stay-at-home order, plans release of some inmates  Federal officials OK Texas\\' request to waive student testing  Harris County extends stay-at-home order, plans release of some inmates  [4:52 p.m.] Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo said she is extending the “stay home, work safe” order in her jurisdiction through April 30. The order mandates that county residents must stay in their residences and can only leave for \"essential activities.”  “It’s not the time right now to scale back in our containment measures. If anything, it’s the time to double down, because our rates continue to grow very rapidly,” Hidalgo said.  She added that she is supportive of the order issued Tuesday by Gov. Greg Abbott and that if “his order conflicts with our order, we will work that out in the future.”  Hidalgo also announced that she is signing an order to release an estimated 1,000 Harris County jail inmates. The order would apply to those who are not convicted and those who are in jail on nonviolent charges. There could be exceptions, and each case will be reviewed.  “We know that the Harris County jail is a ticking time bomb. We already have a case in the jail. We are likely to see more in the coming days,” Hidalgo said. “Public health experts have made clear that it’s a dangerous situation.”  Following Abbott’s executive order signed Sunday, Hidalgo won’t release anyone previously convicted for violent offenses. She explained that this measure is not just about the approximately 8,000 inmates in the jail, but also about the 3,000 workers in the jail and their families, who could be exposed to the coronavirus.— Juan Pablo Garnham  Texas reports 3,266 cases and 41 deaths  [1:30 p.m.] Texas reported 389 more cases of the new coronavirus Tuesday, bringing the total number of known cases to 3,266. Nearly half of the state’s 254 counties have reported at least one case.  The state is also reporting three additional deaths, bringing the statewide total to 41. Dallas County and Comal County each reported one additional death, and Ellis County reported its first death.  Harris County has reported the most cases, 563, followed by Dallas County, which has reported 549 cases. Dallas County is also reporting 11 deaths, more than any other county. Bexar County has reported five deaths, giving it the second-highest total.  As of Monday, at least 42,992 tests have been conducted in Texas. — Darla Cameron  Paxton gets temporary victory on abortion ban  [1:15 p.m.] Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton scored a temporary victory in his legal battle to halt abortions during the COVID-19 pandemic after a federal appeals court sided with the state Tuesday.  Last week, citing an executive order by Gov. Greg Abbott to postpone unnecessary medical procedures, Paxton said that abortions should not be performed unless the mother’s life is in danger. But on Monday, a federal judge temporarily blocked the state\\'s ban on abortions, writing that Paxton\\'s interpretation of Abbott\\'s order \"prevents Texas women from exercising what the Supreme Court has declared is their fundamental constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before a fetus is viable.”  On Tuesday morning, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals stayed the lower court\\'s block, temporarily allowing the ban to proceed as the case continues. Paxton declared victory on Twitter. — Juan Pablo Garnham  Federal officials OK Texas\\' request to waive student testing  [1:12 pm.] The U.S. Department of Education granted Texas’ request to waive student testing and school accountability requirements for the school year after a statewide closure of all public schools due to the new coronavirus.  In a letter dated Friday, the federal government effectively gave Texas permission to cancel its state standardized tests this year, normally an annual requirement of each state. Texas announced the STAAR cancellation earlier this month and gave schools leeway to determine whether students can graduate without it. — Aliyya Swaby  28 people in Austin test positive after spring break trip  [12:17 p.m.] Austin Public Health reported that 28 young adults coming back from a spring break trip in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, have tested positive for COVID-19 and that dozens more are under a public health investigation. KXAN-TV reported that many of them are students at the University of Texas at Austin.  According to a press release, a group of approximately 70 people departed to Mexico a week and a half ago on a charter flight. Some of them returned in commercial flights, and 28 people in the group have tested positive so far. Four of the confirmed cases haven’t shown symptoms, and all of them are self-isolating, according to authorities. At the time, Mexico was not under a federal travel advisory, but Austin Public Health had indicated that all nonessential international travel should be avoided, following the recommendations of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Public Health data shows that nearly half of those testing positive for COVID-19 in Travis County are between the ages of 20 and 40. — Juan Pablo Garnham  Dallas mayor urges people to avoid overcrowding of parks  [11:32 a.m.] Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson urged people to keep a safe distance from one another when using the city’s trails and parks. This weekend, two of the most popular green spaces in Dallas — the Katy Trail and White Rock Lake — experienced severe overcrowding, leading to criticism from Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins.  “I\\'m asking our residents to please keep your distance and to help us keep the public safe and to keep the city open-air amenities open for as long as they can,” the mayor said in a news conference Tuesday.  City Manager T.C. Broadnax added that the city could institute citations and fines for up to $2,000 for people and businesses defying orders. The city’s Department of Transportation is also analyzing the potential closure of car traffic on specific streets to alleviate overcrowding of the city’s parks, a practice that has proved successful in many cities around the world.  In Tuesday\\'s news conference, Johnson also addressed the idea of taking stronger actions against evictions, proposed by City Council member Adam Bazaldua. Johnson said that this has to be discussed with the city’s COVID-19 committee.  “We need this committee to vet this idea before we act on it. It has significant legal ramifications, and we cannot afford to rush into something that\\'s this far reaching,” Johnson said.  Also at the news conference, the Office of Emergency Management said that the medical community is meeting to assess exactly what the city will need from the announced pop-up hospital in the Kay Bailey Hutchison Convention Center and that the facility will be operated by a 225-member Navy medical unit. — Juan Pablo Garnham  Military to stop disclosing number of cases at facilities  [10:05 a.m.] The U.S. military will stop reporting the number of COVID-19 cases on its bases and other command stations, multiple news outlets reported Monday  The directive from the Pentagon comes as the number of cases linked to the military passed 1,000, ABC and CNN reported. The Pentagon cited security concerns for the order.  “We will not report the aggregate number of individual service member cases at individual unit, base or Combatant Commands. We will continue to do our best to balance transparency in this crisis with operational security,\" Pentagon spokeswoman Alyssa Farah said in a statement.  The order includes El Paso’s Fort Bliss, which had reported seven cases as of Monday. The San Antonio Express-News reported that as of Friday, the Joint Base San Antonio website said that \"28 military personnel, dependents and retirees had tested positive,\" but that information was later removed.  “Cover-up is the worst damn thing you can do when you’re having [the] serious issue that we’re having today with COVID-19,” Bexar County Judge Nelson Wolff said, according to the Express-News.  A spokesperson for the Texas Department of State Health Services the agency had a few reports from bases early on, but “bases began testing on their own and we have not been asked for further assistance.” — Julián Aguilar  Second death at Dallas senior-living facility  [8:54 a.m.] A second COVID-19 death has been reported at the Edgemere senior-living facility in North Dallas, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said Monday evening at a news conference. Jenkins added that there are also 10 new cases of the disease at the Skyline Nursing Center, in the south of the city, and another case at the Reserve, a center in Richardson.  According to The Dallas Morning News, Jenkins suggested Sunday that people should consider bringing loved ones home from these facilities, but he later clarified that this wasn’t an order, but a recommendation for those who have the resources to do so. — Juan Pablo Garnham  Disclosure: The University of Texas at Austin has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors. Financial supporters play no role in the Tribune\\'s journalism. Find a complete list of them here.  Correction: An item on a Dallas news conference had misstated the name of Dallas City Manager T.C. Broadnax. Also, an item on the military disclosure of cases was updated to note that the Joint Base San Antonio website had reported at one point that 28 military personnel, dependents and retirees had tested positive.'"

       "\"Sunday's biggest developments  Harris County jail reports its first case  Texas is reporting more than 2,500 coronavirus cases  Harris County jail inmate tests positive  [1:50 p.m.] A 39-year-old inmate in the Harris County jail has tested positive for the new coronavirus, marking the first case there, the county sheriff’s office announced Sunday. The inmate, who was booked into jail March 17 after being arrested for a parole violation, was placed into quarantine March 26 when a health assessment showed he had a high temperature.  Some 30 inmates in the jail are showing “symptoms consistent with COVID-19.” Roughly 500 inmates who may have been exposed to the virus but are not showing symptoms are in quarantine, the sheriff’s office said in a release Sunday.  Inmates are at a particularly high risk for contracting and spreading the virus given the close quarters and unsanitary conditions in jails and prisons. The virus has already begun to spread in Texas lockups.  As of Saturday, 11 people — one detention service officer and 10 inmates — in the Dallas County jail had tested positive for the virus. — Emma Platoff  Texas reports 500 more coronavirus cases  [1:40 p.m.] Texas reported 500 more cases of the new coronavirus Sunday, bringing the total number of known cases to 2,552. Nearly half of the state's 254 counties have reported at least one case.  The state records 445 cases in Harris County — an increase of 94% from the number of cases in the county Saturday. Dallas County saw an additional 72 cases, which is an increase of around 20%.  There were seven more deaths reported in Texas for a total of 34. Dallas County reported two additional deaths. Harris County, Denton County, Brazos County, Williamson County and Van Zandt County reported one additional death each.  As of Sunday, 25,483 tests have been conducted in Texas. This is an increase of 223 tests from Saturday's total. The Tribune reported Saturday that many who have gotten tested are waiting as long as 10 days for results. — Mandi Cai\""

Trump and the CDC on March 16, 2020, call upon Americans to slow the spread of COVID-19 by avoiding social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people, using drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options at restaurants and bars, and avoiding visitation at nursing homes, among other steps; and  WHEREAS, the Texas Department of State Health Services has now determined that, as of March 19, 2020, COVID- 19 represents a public health disaster within the meaning of Chapter 81 of the Texas Health and Safety Code; and  WHEREAS, under the Texas Disaster Act of 1975, “[t]he governor is responsible for meeting . . . the dangers to the state and people presented by disasters” (Section 418.001 of the Texas Government Code), and the legislature has given the governor broad authority to fulfill that responsibility.  NOW, THEREFORE, I, Greg Abbott, Governor of Texas, by virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the State of Texas, do hereby order the following on a statewide basis effective 11:59 p.m. on March 20, 2020, and continuing until 11:59 p.m. on April 3, 2020, subject to extension thereafter based on the status of COVID-19 in Texas and the recommendations of the CDC:  Order No. 1 - In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, every person in Texas shall avoid social gatherings in groups of more than 10 people.  Order No. 2 - In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, people shall avoid eating or drinking at bars, restaurants, and food courts, or visiting gyms or massage parlors; provided, however, that the use of drive-thru, pickup, or delivery options is allowed and highly encouraged throughout the limited duration of this executive order.  Order No. 3 - In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, people shall not visit nursing homes or retirement or long-term care facilities unless to provide critical assistance.  Order No. 4 - In accordance with the Guidelines from the President and the CDC, schools shall temporarily close.    This, executive order does not prohibit people from visiting a variety of places, including grocery stores, gas stations, parks, and banks, so long as the necessary precautions are maintained to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. This executive order does not mandate sheltering in place. All critical infrastructure will remain operational, domestic travel will remain unrestricted, and government entities and businesses will continue providing essential services. For offices and workplaces that remain open, employees should practice good hygiene and, where feasible, work from home in order to achieve optimum isolation from COVD-19. The more that people reduce their public contact, the sooner COVID-19 will be contained and the sooner this executive order will expire.  This executive order supersedes all previous orders on this matter that are in conflict or inconsistent with its terms, and this order shall remain in effect and in full force until 11:59 p.m. on April 3, 2020, subject to being extended, modified, amended, rescinded, or superseded by me or by a succeeding governor.  Given under my hand this the 19th day of March, 2020.    Governor Greg Abbott  View the executive orders'"

Abbott so far has not issued a similar order statewide, but warned that could change if previous orders regarding social gatherings weren\\'t followed.Those orders limit gatherings to under 10 people, closed schools, bars and gyms and banned dine-in eating at restaurants.\"Stricter standards will be taken,\" if necessary, Abbott said. \"If you don\\'t have an essential reason for leaving your home, you should not be leaving your home.\"The announcement came as the Texas Department of State Health Services reported 334 people statewide have tested positive for the virus, up from 304 on Saturday, and officials in Dallas said a man in his 80s has become the sixth Texan with the disease to die.The vast majority of people who contract the virus recover within weeks.

Greg Abbott to provide update on state's efforts to limit COVID-19 spread  Report: Texas looking to join program allowing online grocery orders for SNAP recipients  Oil and gas regulators meet after prices plunge into the negatives  Report: Texas looking to join program allowing online grocery orders for SNAP recipients  [10:55 a.m.] Texas has requested to be part of a pilot program that allows SNAP recipients to order groceries online, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reports.  Currently Lone Star Cards — Texas’ electronic benefit transfer card which works like a debit card — can only be used to buy groceries in-store as deemed by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program. While many Texans have turned to online grocery shopping and delivery services to limit exposure to the new coronavirus, these resources aren’t available to families who use SNAP.  In-person shopping has long been a concern for groups including the elderly, people with disabilities and people in food-insecure areas, whose access barriers have only been exacerbated by the pandemic. As of Tuesday, the pilot program, which launched in April, is only available through Amazon, Walmart and a few local grocery stores in Alabama, Florida, Iowa, Nebraska, New York, Oregon and Washington, according to the USDA. — Stacy Fernández  Gov. Greg Abbott to provide update on state’s efforts  [10:35 a.m.] In a 2 p.m. news conference Tuesday, Gov. Greg Abbott will provide the latest information about efforts to limit the spread of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Nearly 20,000 Texans have tested positive, and 495 died from the virus as of April 20, according to state health officials. You can watch the news conference here.  Texas Railroad Commission holds first meeting after oil prices drop to historic lows  [5 a.m.] The Texas Railroad Commission, which regulates the state’s oil and gas industry, is scheduled to meet at 9:30 a.m. Tuesday after a historic Monday, when oil prices plunged into the negatives. The commission also met last week and took more than 10 hours of testimony from dozens of energy executives, analysts and critics who disagreed about whether the state agency should limit production.  Some say that such cuts would help, while others say the commission should not interfere in the free market, which is being battered by a huge drop in demand.  “We are evaluating all options to protect Texas operators and mineral owners,” Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, told The Texas Tribune. — Mitchell Ferman  Texas nears 20,000 positive cases as nearly 500 people have died  [5 a.m.] Texas officials are expected Tuesday afternoon to release the latest number of people who have tested positive for the novel coronavirus.

       "'DALLAS, Texas – Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Sunday said the National Guard could begin monitoring drive-in testing sites on Monday, and the Republican declined at a news conference to follow the lead of other states with a statewide “shelter in place” order.  But Abbott warned Texans that it could be coming if they don’t heed his previous orders on Friday that limited social gatherings to under 10 people, closed schools, bars and gyms and banned dine-in eating at restaurants.  “Stricter standards will be taken,” if necessary, Abbott said. “If you don’t have an essential reason for leaving your home, you should not be leaving your home.”  Meanwhile, the top elected official in Dallas County on Sunday issued the strictest order in Texas so far.  Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins issued an order telling residents to shelter in their homes except for “essential activities.\" The order also prohibits gatherings beyond a single household and commands non-essential businesses to cease operation outside of people working from home. It takes effect at 11:59 p.m. Monday and will remain in place until the same time on April 3.  The Texas Department of State Health Services reported 334 people statewide have tested positive for the virus, up from 304 on Saturday, and officials in Dallas said a man in his 80s has become the sixth Texas resident with the disease to die.  The vast majority of people who contract the virus recover within weeks. It causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people, but it can lead to more severe illness, including pneumonia, especially in older adults and people with preexisting health problems.  Abbott on Sunday also prodded the federal government to do more to help states secure more tests and medical supplies to fight the spreading coronavirus outbreak.  The governor did not dissuade big-city mayors in Dallas, Houston and Austin from issuing a shelter-in-place order if they think that is best. He said local authorities have the power to enforce stricter standards than he has so far, and noted that more than 200 counties haven’t had a reported positive coronavirus test.  Dallas County has the greatest number of cases, with 30, according to the health department. It is followed by Harris County, with 27, and Bexar County, with 24.  Abbott previously told the National Guard to get ready and said Sunday they can help local officials set up medical tents, reboot previously closed hospitals and medical facilities or monitor the traffic at drive-thru testing sites that are sprouting up the state’s major cities.  He said Texas shares the frustration of other states regarding the federal government\\'s slow response to the coronavirus outbreak.  The governor also urged the federal government to ramp up production of personal protection equipment. He said the state has tried but can’t deliver quickly enough.  “We\\'ve tried strategies.

Greg Abbott on Sunday announced a sweeping series of moves to both slow and manage the growing pandemic.  Just two days after Texas began requiring airline passengers from New Orleans to comply with a two-week quarantine, Abbott said state troopers will now also patrol highway entry points at the Louisiana border and require “everyone stopped” in those cars to also self-isolate. Abbott’s order requires drivers to fill out a form listing where they will quarantine in Texas.  But how aggressively Texas troopers will patrol incoming traffic wasn’t immediately clear. Hours after Abbott’s announcement, traffic both in and out of Texas was freely moving along Interstate 10 near the Sabine River that divides Texas and Louisiana. No state troopers were seen patrolling the interstate, although multiple highway electronic signs in both directions warned drivers that “Personal travel from Louisiana must quarantine.’”  More than 3,500 Louisiana residents have been diagnosed with the disease caused by a new coronavirus, and more than 150 of them have died, according to state figures released Sunday.  For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said a Dallas convention center could be used as a temporary hospital for coronavirus patients and extended an executive order regarding travel.  Abbott also said airline passengers arriving from Miami, Atlanta, Detroit, Chicago or anywhere from California or Washington state must also quarantine for 14 days, or risk jail time if they don’t comply. And as the virus spreads throughout Texas jails, Abbott issued an order prohibiting bond for anyone arrested on charges related to physical violence or with past convictions for violent offenses.  Texas has more than 2,500 cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and at least 34 related deaths.  Nearly 500 cases are in Dallas, according to a running count by Johns Hopkins University. Abbott said there are currently enough beds in Dallas and across Texas to treat patients, but the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers said the city’s convention center could be set up to house as many as 1,400 people if needed.  It would be the first temporary hospital for coronavirus patients in Texas, and Abbott said the state is looking at options in other cities.  “Our job is to make sure that we’re looking one, two, three, four weeks ahead, and make sure that Texas is going to be prepared to meet the needs of your communities if COVID-19 continues to increase,” Abbott said.'"

       "'News Release  March 4, 2020  Travel-related case in Fort Bend County  The Texas Department of State Health Services and Fort Bend County Health and Human Services are reporting the first positive test result for COVID-19 in Texas outside of the passengers returned under federal quarantine from Wuhan City, China or the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The patient is a resident of Fort Bend County who recently returned from travel abroad and is currently isolated in the hospital.  The test was performed at the public health lab in Houston and will be confirmed by testing at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. DSHS is supporting Fort Bend County in identifying any close contacts of the patient while he was sick so they can be isolated and monitored for symptoms and quickly tested, if needed.  “Having a COVID-19 case in Texas is a significant development in this outbreak, but it doesn’t change the fact that the immediate risk to most Texans is low,” said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. “This travel-related case reinforces the fact that we should all be taking basic hygiene steps that are extremely effective in limiting the spread of COVID-19 and all respiratory illnesses.”  From the research into COVID-19, we know that about 80 percent of cases are mild with most people not needing hospitalization. However, older adults and people with underlying health conditions like heart disease, lung disease and diabetes are at a greater risk of complications.  DSHS and other state agencies in Texas have been preparing for the arrival of COVID-19 since it was first identified in China and began spreading to other countries. Planning has been going on continuously for laboratory testing, public health investigation and isolation and care for people who test positive.  “Over the past month, the state of Texas has been preparing for this moment, and we are confident in the steps we have taken to safeguard our communities against the coronavirus,” said Governor Greg Abbott. “We anticipated this situation, we have protocols in place, and our state agencies and personnel are trained and ready to respond. The state of Texas remains in contact with our federal and local partners, and we will continue to work together to ensure Texas communities have the resources they need to respond to any additional cases of the coronavirus. Our top priority is public health and safety, and I urge all Texans to follow the preventative guidelines provided by the Department of State Health Services.”  A travel-related case in Texas doesn’t indicate spread within the state, but DSHS, the Texas Division of Emergency Management, and all state agencies continue their ongoing preparations so that all of state government is working together to limit the spread of the virus and protect Texans.  \"Protecting and preserving the health and safety of Texans is at the very core of what we do at HHS. We will do everything we can to make sure Texans have the information and resources they need to take care of themselves and their families,\" said Dr. Courtney N. Phillips, Texas Health and Human Services Executive Commissioner. \"We have in place a comprehensive public health surveillance system to proactively identify, respond to and prevent the spread of disease, all led by the outstanding team at DSHS. Please watch our HHS social media channels and website for updates as events and circumstances warrant.\"  Human coronaviruses like the one that causes COVID-19 are most commonly spread through coughing and sneezing, personal contact like shaking hands, and touching a surface with the virus and then touching your eyes, nose or mouth. There are simple steps everyone can take to help prevent spreading them:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  The public can find up-to-date coronavirus information at dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus, and DSHS will be sharing new information on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram at @TexasDSHS.      -30-    (News Media Contact: Chris Van Deusen, DSHS Director of Media Relations, 512-776-7119)  '"

       "'AUSTIN (KXAN) — KXAN is keeping track of COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, by aggregating data from the Texas Department of State Health Services and local and county health departments. Click here for data specific to Central Texas.  How many cases are there in Texas?  The state’s first case of COVID-19 was reported March 4 in Fort Bend County. As of August 15, Texas has officially reported 528,838 cases of COVID-19 in the state.  Charts can be swiped left and right. Tap to explore the data  How many people have been tested?  Texas is currently administering two types of test: viral/PCR and antibody tests. Viral/PCR tests determine whether someone currently has COVID-19. Antibody tests determine whether someone was previously infected. On May 13, the state started reporting the number of each tests separately. Prior to that, the test types were combined and reported as one number. Due to a “technical problem with electronic lab reports,” test data for May 23 and 24 are not available.  DSHS reports test results a day late. As of August 14, 4,321,676 molecular tests have been reported by the state. A total of 12.05 percent of all tests have come back positive. That means 87.95 percent of tests have been negative. The state’s seven-day average positive rate is 14.62 percent.  Charts can be swiped left and right. Tap to explore the data  Charts can be swiped left and right. Tap to explore the data  In addition, 17,011 antigen test results have been reported. Of those, 2,591 tests have been positive, giving an overall positive rate of 15.23 percent. Positive antigen tests are considered “probable” cases and not included in the state’s confirmed case total.  Texas has also reported 318,938 antibody test results. A total of 23,192 of those tests have come back positive. That’s a positive rate of 7.27 percent.  On August 13, DSHS added approximately 95,000 previously-unreported test results to the state’s total. The state says this was partly due to a lab reporting system upgrade on August 1 that enabled the system to process a higher volume of test results. This allowed DSHS to clear test that had been previously reported to the patient but not uploaded to the system.  Another factor was a coding error that was resolved in a hospital and commercial lab. The error had prevented test numbers from those locations from being uploaded to DSHS’ lab reporting system. Approximately 95,000 of the newly-reported 124,000 molecular tests on August 13 were part of the backlog from the hospital.  On August 15, DSHS reported that several commercial laboratories submitted backlogged test results over the prior week. Patients were notified at the time of diagnosis through a separate process.  How has the number of cases changed over time?  KXAN is keeping track of the daily increase in COVID-19 cases across Texas. The highest daily jump occurred on July 15, when 10,791 new cases were added to the state’s total. The largest increase in deaths in a single day occurred on August 12, when 324 new deaths were reported.  On June 16, DSHS reported an additional 1,476 cases and seven deaths that had previously gone unreported. These cases were among TDCJ prison inmates in Anderson and Brazoria County.  On July 15, DSHS announced that the San Antonio Metro Health District had been reporting probable cases in its total for Bexar County, rather than just confirmed cases. As a result, 3,484 probable cases were removed from the county and state total.  On July 17, DSHS announced around 4,662 previously-uncounted cases in Bexar County. According to San Antonio Metro Health, the cases had not been reported as “the result of a backlog in the reporting process.” In a press release, the local health department said, “All of the patients who tested positive were notified by the lab within three or four days, so this backlog did not affect patients learning their test results.”  On July 25, DSHS announced that the Corpus Christi-Nueces County Public Health District had been reporting probable cases in its total. As a result, 2,092 probable cases were removed from the county and state total.  On August 3, DSHS removed 471 cases from Bexar County’s total. Those had been duplicate cases reported by San Antonio Metro Health.  On August 11, DSHS announced 890 previously-uncounted cases in Nueces County. According to the state, these cases stemmed “from a laboratory reporting backlog.”  Charts can be swiped left and right. Tap to explore the data  Charts can be swiped left and right. Tap to explore the data  How many people are in the hospital?  DSHS reports 6,481 COVID-19 patients are currently hospitalized across the state. As of August 15, 5.15 percent of active cases currently require hospitalization.  Between July 23 and July 28, DSHS reported incomplete hospitalization data “due to a transition in reporting to comply with new federal requirements.” Because of this transition, not every hospital was able to provide complete data to the state, resulting in a partial data set:  On July 23, 84.5 percent of hospitals reported complete data  On July 24, 90 percent of hospitals reported complete data  On July 25, 89 percent of hospitals reported complete data  On July 26, 85 percent of hospitals reported complete data  On July 27, 82 percent of hospitals reported complete data  On July 28, 91 percent of hospitals reported complete data  The percent of hospitals reporting data returned to normal levels on July 29.

DSHS is estimating that 393,266 patients have recovered from COVID-19 across the state, as of August 15. The number is an estimate based on assumptions related to hospitalization rates and recovery times, according to the state. Based on this, KXAN estimates 125,732 cases are still active.

How many people have died?  The state’s first COVID-19-related death was reported March 16 in Matagorda County. As of August 15, the state has officially reported 9,840 deaths. Harris County has the most deaths related to COVID-19, with 1,812.  Charts can be swiped left and right. Tap to explore the data  On July 27, DSHS changed the way it reports COVID-19 deaths, resulting in a surge in the death toll. The state previously counted COVID-19 fatalities after local health departments verified the deaths. Now, the state is identifying COVID-19 deaths using the cause of death listed on death certificates.  DSHS says this new method “allows fatalities to be counted faster with more comprehensive demographic data.” The state says it is only counting deaths in which “COVID-19 directly caused the death,” as determined by the medical certifier, usually a doctor with direct knowledge of the patient. The total number of deaths does not include people who had COVID-19 but died from an unrelated cause.  Because of this change, 675 new deaths were added to the state’s total on July 27. Only 44 of those were new deaths that had been reported that day.  On July 30, DSHS reported that during the shift to using death certificate data to count COVID-19 deaths, an “automation error” caused 225 deaths to be included that were not directly caused by COVID-19. A manual quality check of data revealed the issue late on July 29. Those deaths have since been removed from the state’s total.  Reported Deaths in Texas Hover or tap the counties below to see the known number of deaths related to COVID-19. Mobile users can zoom in and move the map using two-finger touch.  Editor’s Note: KXAN previously provided a count of cases and deaths, as reported by local and county health departments. As of August 6, KXAN is no longer providing that count, and is instead solely reporting data provided by DSHS.'"

       "'Sunday\\'s biggest developments:  Many Texas schools could be closed for weeks — maybe the rest of the school year.  CDC recommends canceling all events with 50 or more people.  Community spread detected in Matagorda County.  State extends the expiration date of some driver\\'s licenses  [9:12 p.m.] In an effort to fight the spread of the new coronavirus and keep people out of long lines in state facilities, the Texas Department of Public Safety said Sunday that it\\'s extending the expiration date of all driver\\'s licenses to 60 days after the end of the disaster declaration in the state of Texas.  The decision applies to any driver\\'s license, personal ID card, commercial driver\\'s license or election identification certificate that expires on March 13, 2020 or later.  Many Texas schools could be closed through academic year due to coronavirus, education commissioner warns  [9 p.m.] Texas Education Commissioner Mike Morath told school superintendents and lawmakers Sunday to be prepared for long-term school district closures, potentially through the end of the school year, especially in areas where the new coronavirus has spread.  According to individuals who participated in two separate conference calls with the commissioner, Morath said he would still leave the decision up to local superintendents. This comes as hundreds of school districts announced they would suspend classes for at least a week, with concerns about COVID-19 spreading through their communities. — Aliyya Swaby  CDC recommends no gatherings of 50 or more people for next 8 weeks  [6:35 p.m.] In a guidance issued Sunday evening, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that organizers cancel or postpone any in-person events that include 50 people or more for the next eight weeks.  \"Large events and mass gatherings can contribute to the spread of COVID-19 in the United States via travelers who attend these events and introduce the virus to new communities,\" the guidance says.  The guidance only pertains to events, not day-to-day operations of schools or businesses. It is also only a recommendation and does not overrule decisions made at the local level. Texas has no statewide ban of large events in place, though local officials have canceled numerous events and most major festivals and sporting events have already been canceled. Austin has banned gatherings of 250 people or more, for instance.  \"This recommendation is made in an attempt to reduce introduction of the virus into new communities and to slow the spread of infection in communities already affected by the virus,\" the guidance says.  State distributing more medical supplies  [4:06 p.m.] The Texas Department of State Health Services has started to distribute surgical masks and other various medical supplies to health care entities to help with responding to the new coronavirus.  The department, which announced the news Sunday afternoon, said Texas received the medical equipment from the Strategic National Stockpile, a federal-run repository aimed at helping states during national emergencies.  Items ranged from masks to respirators and face shields and gloves. Equipment had first arrived Saturday at a San Antonio warehouse, the department said. More would be sent to local partners, DSHS said, which would then distribute to local providers and health care facilities in the area. — Cassi Pollock  UT-Austin President tests negative for COVID-19  [2:15 p.m.] University of Texas at Austin President Greg Fenves has tested negative for the coronavirus and has not experienced any symptoms since late Thursday.  According to an email alert from Amy Young, UT Health Austin’s Chief Clinical Officer, Fenves will continue to self-isolate and monitor for symptoms.  UT is still in the process of contacting individuals who have had close contact with Fenves.  “Because of President Fenves’ extensive contact with those in his family who have tested positive and the fact that he had demonstrated symptoms, there remains a possibility he may have been infectious prior to his COVID-19 testing,” Young wrote. “Therefore, public health authorities are recommending continued self-isolation for those who were in close contact.”  On March 13, Fenves announced that his wife Carmel tested positive for the coronavirus after a visit to New York in early March.  “After the trip, Carmel started exhibiting mild flu-like symptoms. She tested negative for the flu yesterday and was then tested for COVID-19. This morning at 5:30 a.m., we received the news that she had tested positive,” Fenves wrote in a letter to the university community. — Raga Justin  Latest coronavirus count climbs to 68 cases statewide  [12:30 p.m.] The state’s coronavirus count reached 68 cases as of noon Sunday. Four counties are now reporting community spread: Brazoria, Dallas, Matagorda and Montgomery. In total, 17 counties–– and the Lackland Air Force Base–– are reporting at least one coronavirus case. Since Saturday at 7 p.m., the state has reported an additional five cases. — Raga Justin  Community spread suspected in Matagorda County  [12:20 p.m.] Matagorda County reported its first case of the new coronavirus Saturday, in what is likely another example of community spread.  The patient is a woman in her 60s who lives in the county. According to a press release, the patient was first admitted to the Matagorda Regional Medical Center due to complications with pneumonia, prompting workers to test her for the coronavirus. The patient is in fair condition and remains in the hospital to continue treatment for her pneumonia, the release said. Aaron Fox, a spokesman for the county hospital district, said the patient did not report any international travel but had traveled in and around Texas.  While not yet confirmed by officials, Fox said the county is “preparing to lean more to the community spread mindset.”Dallas, Montgomery and Brazoria Counties previously reported community spread as well. — Raga Justin  DFW one of 13 U.S. airports accepting flights from Europe  [11:00 a.m.] The chaos and crowds seemed to have subsided at the Dallas/Fort Worth Airport on Sunday morning.  An airport spokesman said the lines were back to normal, following hundreds of travelers returning from Europe complaining about wait times that lasted several hours on Saturday night.  The DFW Airport is one of 13 U.S. airports accepting flights from Europe and other regions impacted by the coronavirus.  A spokesperson for U.S. Customs and Border Protection, said they are working around the clock to minimize inconveniences going forward.  \"CBP recognizes that the wait times experienced yesterday at some locations were unacceptable. As we work collaboratively with federal, state, and local agencies to address the spread of COVID-19, some of the resources of our partners are stretched thin. CBP continually adjusts its resources, in real time, as needed and we will continue to do so. We understand the inconvenience to travelers and be assured that our top priority is to ensure the safety, and security of the American people while bolstering our economic security with the facilitation of legitimate trade and travel,\" Acting CBP Commissioner Mark Morgan said in a statement.  Photos of long lines emerged late Saturday night from other international airports — in Chicago and New York — that led to travelers complaining of hours-long waits to enter Customs. Some travelers on social media posted that they were worried about being packed with hundreds of other people when officials across the country have been urging the public to keep a distance from others in hopes of reducing the spread of COVID-19. —Mitchell Ferman'"

The policy, which the publication said could be announced within the next two days, would apply to unauthorized crossers apprehended in between the ports of entry. The apprehended migrants would not be able to apply for asylum nor would they be detained.  The New York Times said the effort was part of the administration\\'s attempt to contain the spread of COVID-19 and to protect border agents from becoming infected.  The new effort by the Trump administration comes the same day Guatemala announced it is suspending flights from the United States of deportees and asylum seekers, the AP reported. The country entered into an agreement where it accepted some Central American asylum seekers who traveled through Mexico in route to the United States. — Julián Aguilar  Direct payments to Americans could be part of federal economic stimulus bill  [9:25 p.m.] President Donald Trump\\'s administration wants to include direct cash payments to Americans as the country reels from the economic beating people and businesses are taking amid a mounting social shutdown meant to stop the new coronavirus from spreading, The Washington Post reported.  “We’re looking at sending checks to Americans immediately,” Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told reporters Tuesday. “And I mean now, in the next two weeks.\"  While there is bipartisan support for sending Americans checks, lawmakers are split over other aspects of the roughly $1 trillion stimulus package, including bailouts to large industries, the paper reported.  Abbott: State-regulated health plans must pay telemedicine doctors equally  [7:37 p.m.] In an effort to expand access to telemedicine services, Gov. Greg Abbott announced Tuesday that state-regulated health plans must pay doctors who see patients remotely as much as they would pay for in-person visits.  “Expanding telemedicine options will help protect the health of patients and health care professionals, while help[ing] Texas mitigate the spread of COVID-19,” Abbott said in a statement.  Approximately 16% of Texans have health insurance through a state-regulated plan. The Texas Department of Insurance will issue the emergency rule, Abbott\\'s office said. — Edgar Walters  Community spread arrives in San Antonio, according to report  San Antonio officials on Tuesday night reported the first instance of community spread of the novel coronavirus in that city.  According to the San Antonio Express-News, the patient made contact with a previously diagnosed person.  Bexar County is the latest Texas county to report an instance of community spread, which is what health officials call cases where the source of exposure is unknown. Earlier today, Webb and Tarrant counties reported separate cases of community transmission. — Alex Samuels  Abbott trying to get small Texas businesses qualified for federal relief loans  [5:16 p.m.] Gov. Greg Abbott requested emergency designation this evening for small-business disaster loans from the U.S. Small Business Administration. If granted, according to Abbott’s office, the SBA would provide long-term, low-interest loans to “qualifying businesses” across the state.  “At a time when small businesses are hurting from the economic impact of COVID-19, the State of Texas is committed to helping these businesses receive the financial relief they need to continue operating,” Abbott said in a statement.  The request comes after major cities — Austin, Houston, Dallas and others — announced the temporary closure of bars and in-house restaurant service to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus. The partial shutdowns, in some cases, are expected to extend until May 1.  Read the full letter from Abbott here. — Alex Samuels  El Paso shutters bars; restaurants can stay open with restrictions  [4:20 p.m.] The El Paso City Council voted Tuesday to order bars, arcades and private clubs to close. Restaurants will remain open but will be restricted to allowing half of their posted occupancies and no more than six people at one table. The tables must also be 6 feet apart, and non-food surfaces must be cleaned hourly.  The council also voted to ban gatherings of more than 50 people, although the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention lowered its recommendation to 10 people Monday.  The city confirmed its third case of COVID-19 on Monday, and health officials said it has tested 33 patients. There is also one confirmed case across the border in Ciudad Juárez.  The council also ordered price freezes on groceries; medicine; toiletries; gas and electric generators; most construction, plumbing and building materials; and other essential products until its disaster declaration expires. — Julián Aguilar  Texas Capitol to be closed  [3:45 p.m.] The Texas Capitol will be closed to the public beginning Wednesday morning, the State Preservation Board announced Tuesday afternoon.  Elected officials and staff will still be able to enter the building, as will state agency personnel with state IDs. Vendors and other deliveries will be allowed as well, so long as staff meets them at the entrance of the building. The Capitol Visitors Center and the Texas State Cemetery, along with all gift shops and the Capitol Grill, will also be closed. — Cassandra Pollock  Hospital workers sound alarm about capacity challenges  [3:02 p.m.] The front lines of Texas’ health care workforce are preparing for the possibility of widespread COVID-19 infection — and sounding the alarm about the state’s limited number of hospital beds.  Texas’ hospital capacity — the number of beds available per person in the general population — is about 2.9 beds per 1,000 Texans, according to state regulators. The U.S. rate is about 2.8 beds per 1,000 people.  “If we can get people to stay out of crowds, stay out of crowded environments to slow down the transmission of this virus from person to person, we should be able to stretch our resources to the point where we can take care of the entire population that needs hospitalized care,” said Craig Rhyne, the Lubbock-based regional chief medical officer for Covenant Health. — Edgar Walters  Abbott suspends part of Texas Open Meetings Act  [2:57 p.m.] Gov. Greg Abbott suspended a part of the Texas Open Meetings Act — which guarantees the public can access and participate in government meetings — Monday in the midst of the coronavirus pandemic. All sections of the Texas Open Meetings Act remain in place except for the requirement of a physical gathering space for people to watch the meeting and ask questions.  While social distancing practices are in place, governmental bodies — like the city council and school board — are expected to conduct meetings by phone or video conference, Attorney General Ken Paxton said in a statement. It’s likely the case that “regular citizens aren’t clamoring to go to a large gathering of people either,” said Kelley Shannon, executive director of the Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas. — Stacy Fernández  Texas parents struggle as school closings keep kids at home  [2:52 p.m.] As more school districts plan to keep their doors closed long-term, with COVID-19 cases and panicked responses ramping up quickly, families are cobbling together childcare solutions and finagling other forms of financial support. Many don\\'t know where to leave their young children for a full work day, much less how they will be educated weeks down the line.  School districts are offering free meals at sites within their boundaries, and preparing to switch to online education to ensure students keep learning. But, in a majority Hispanic public school system like Texas\\' where almost 61% of students are economically disadvantaged, some will likely slip through the cracks. And in many cases, the news is moving too fast for families to keep track. — Aliyya Swab  State reports its first coronavirus-related death  [1:15 p.m.] The current COVID-19 total for the state is 76 cases as of noon Tuesday. Webb and Tarrant counties are now reporting community spread, following Dallas, Brazoria, Matagorda and Montgomery. In total, 19 counties — and Lackland Air Force Base — are reporting at least one coronavirus case. And the state reported its first coronavirus-related death, an elderly patient in Matagorda County, late Monday night. — Raga Justin  Texas National Guard to be activated to respond to outbreak  [12:38 p.m.] Gov. Greg Abbott announced Tuesday that the Texas National Guard will be activated in response to the novel coronavirus outbreak in the state, which had at least 69 positive cases as of Tuesday morning. While there is no need to deploy them yet, he said, Guard members will be standing ready.  First responders and health care workers will be excluded from the activation, Abbott added.  In total, 1,264 Texans have been tested for COVID-19 so far, Abbott said. That\\'s a significant jump from the roughly 400 people in total the state reported Monday. By the end of the week, he expects the state to be able to test 10,000 people weekly. — Patrick Svitek  Austin closes bars, restaurants  [12:30 p.m.] The city of Austin shuttered bars and restaurants in the state’s capital Tuesday on the heels of similar shutdowns in Dallas and Houston.  The partial shutdown aims to halt the spread of the new coronavirus. It is the latest blow to the state capital\\'s economy, which is still reeling from the aftershocks of canceling South by Southwest, an annual weeklong festival and a staple for Austin. The move also limits gatherings of more than 10 people. — Raga Justin  Banks to temporarily limit access to lobbies  [12:01 p.m.] Following the lead of other industries implementing social distancing policies recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Texas-chartered banks will temporarily limit access to their lobbies and to tellers. Drive-through lanes and ATMs are expected to remain open, the San Antonio Express-News reported.  Texas Department of Banking Commissioner Charles G. Cooper said state banks “will take the necessary measures to continue meeting the financial needs of their customers and those affected, while protecting the health of their employees,” according to the Express-News.  The Texas Financial Code gives Cooper the authority to allow banking institutions to limit physical access in times of emergency, and Cooper’s decision came after Gov. Greg Abbott on Friday declared a disaster declaration in Texas. — Mitchell Ferman  More cases related to community spread in Dallas County  [11:45 a.m.] The number of coronavirus cases tied to community spread in Dallas County is continuing to climb.  Nine more people in the county have tested positive for the new coronavirus. One patient had traveled abroad. Three patients are \"close contacts\" of a previously confirmed patient. And five patients were likely infected through community spread.  Five of the new patients are hospitalized, including three in critical care units. The patients range in age from two women in their 20s to one woman in her 70s.  As of 10 a.m. Tuesday, 24 Dallas County residents have tested positive for the new coronavirus, according to the Dallas County Health and Human Services website. — Alexa Ura  Community spread of coronavirus reported in two more Texas counties  [8:50 a.m] The novel coronavirus appears to have begun spreading through the community in at least two more Texas counties: Webb, along the U.S.-Mexico border, and Tarrant, in North Texas.  Laredo has its first case, an individual who has not traveled to any affected areas recently and is considered a case of community transmission, according to local reports. And Tarrant County declared its sixth positive COVID-19 case, a Grand Prairie resident who \"contracted the virus in Tarrant County with no known exposure to a confirmed case and no recent travel history,\" according to local officials. — Emma Platoff  Austin mayor in favor of closing bars and restaurant dining rooms  [Editor\\'s note: The press conference originally scheduled for 11 a.m. was rescheduled to noon.]  [5 a.m.] Austin Mayor Steve Adler and Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt could decide the fate of area bars and restaurants Tuesday. Officials in Dallas and Harris County shuttered bars and clubs and prohibited restaurants from offering in-person dining Monday. Shortly after, Adler tweeted that he backs those moves and would make an announcement with Eckhardt at noon Tuesday. As officials continue tightening measures to slow the new coronavirus\\' spread, many Texans\\' job security is being wiped out.  Texas appears to lag behind other states in testing for new coronavirus  [5 a.m.] So far, public and federal labs have tested only 439 people in Texas for the new coronavirus, according to figures released late Monday by the Texas Department of State Health Services. That does not include “hundreds” more tests conducted by private labs, officials said. That presumably leaves the number of Texas tests somewhere north of 700 people, but The Texas Tribune could not pin down officials on a precise count.  But figures provided by DSHS, together with statistics gathered by The COVID Tracking Project, appear to put Texas, the second most populous state, toward the bottom of the country\\'s top five states, depending on which figures for Texas are used. As of late Monday, California had tested at least 8,300 people; New York had tested 7,200; Florida had tested 1,300; and Illinois had tested 1,025, figures show.  Where Texas ultimately lands on the testing spectrum won’t be clear until the dust settles a bit on all the fast-moving coronavirus developments and the reporting of data from states improves. Nationwide, the Trump administration said, almost 2 million tests would be available to some 2,000 labs by the end of this week.  Disclosure: Steve Adler, a former Texas Tribune board chairman, and SXSW have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors. Financial supporters play no role in the Tribune\\'s journalism. Find a complete list of them here.'"

       "'Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Friday declared a state of disaster as the coronavirus pandemic spreads to the state\\'s largest cities.  The declaration came as the number of COVID-19 cases climbed and reached into San Antonio and Austin, where illnesses were reported for the first time Friday.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Friday declared a state of disaster as the coronavirus pandemic spreads to the state’s largest cities.  Texas now has at least 39 confirmed cases of the virus, and Abbott said 220 people had been tested as of Friday.  Questions have mounted about why so few tests had been done in a state of 29 million people, but Abbott said at a news conference that testing would begin ramping up, including San Antonio launching drive-thru testing for first responders and certain high-risk patients.  \"This is not a death sentence we\\'re dealing with here.\"  - Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R)  \"This is not a death sentence we\\'re dealing with here,\" Abbott said. \"This is a typical outcome that we expect to see. Working together, I know we can do it.\"  The declaration follows Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson issuing a proclamation late Thursday declaring a local state of disaster for the city of 1.3 million people, shortly after a countywide ban on large public gatherings of 500 or more people was announced.  Dallas Mayor Eric Johnson reiterated that citizens need to take the threat of coronavirus and limiting social gathering seriously following Thursday’s declaration of a public health emergency.  Tarrant County Judge Glen Whitley announced a similar disaster declaration for the county just minutes after Abbott\\'s announcement.  The coronavirus -- which was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization on Wednesday -- causes only mild or moderate symptoms for most people. But it can cause more severe illness including pneumonia in older adults and people with existing health problems. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus, which causes COVID-19, within weeks.  Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins announced Thursday night that he has filed a Declaration of Local Disaster for Public Health Emergency and am issuing a community gatherings order effective 11:00 a.m. Friday, March 13, 2020.  Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins said smaller gatherings of 250 people should be canceled or rescheduled. He said schools, office towers, airports and movie theaters are exempt, the Dallas Morning News reported.  \"I know Dallas County is up to the challenge,\" Jenkins said. \"Use your brains, as we\\'re all very good at doing in this community. I want everyone to soberly consider and take responsibility for your life decisions.\"  Also late Thursday, Dallas County announced five more cases of the illness, including one that was being investigated as community-spread.  In medical offices around North Texas, doctors are testing for COVID-19. But when the symptoms look like a lot of other illnesses seen this time of year, doctors say they must check several boxes before they do.  In Austin, local health officials said early Friday that the first two cases of coronavirus have been confirmed in the area.  Meanwhile, the pandemic swept new worries through the 50,000-student campus at the University of Texas, which abruptly canceled classes after the wife of the school president tested positive.  University of Texas President Greg Fenves said another member of his family is also believed to have COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus, and that he had also been tested. He said his wife, Carmel, started feeling ill following a trip to New York last week and that his family was in self-quarantine.  The announcement by Fenves came hours after the university -- one of the largest in the U.S. -- canceled classes and closed the campus, which previously had no confirmed cases.  Austin health officials said the two patients are a man in his 60s who is hospitalized in critical condition and a woman in her 30s who is quarantined at home. The man had already been ill when he was transferred from a rural area elsewhere in the state. The woman was connected to another previously diagnosed case in the Houston area.  Officials said the two cases are not connected and they are working to reach anyone they may have been in contact with, said Dr. Mark Escott, interim health authority for Austin.  \"These do not represent community spread. They are linked to another case or jurisdiction,\" Escott said. \"We expect to see more cases, we expect there to be some element of community, person-to-person spread.\"  Austin Mayor Steve Adler said the city had been preparing for the virus to arrive and had taken advance steps to mitigate, most notably canceling the South by Southwest music, movie and tech festivals that bring more than 400,000 people to Austin. The city canceled schools Friday ahead of next week\\'s spring break.  \"This is a virus that we have known was coming to us. It has no come to us,\" Adler said. \"Let\\'s be calm and deal with what\\'s in front of us.\"  How to Avoid COVID-19 Infection:  The best way to prevent infection is to take precautions to avoid exposure to this virus, which are similar to the precautions you take to avoid the flu. CDC always recommends these everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  *Information shared from the Office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott'"

       "'News Release  March 17, 2020  The Texas Department of State Health Services has confirmed the first death of a Texas resident who tested positive for COVID-19, the illness caused by the new coronavirus. The patient was a man in his 90s who was a resident of Matagorda County and had been hospitalized. DSHS is investigating the source of the infection and determining who the patient came into contact with while he was sick so any close contacts can be isolated, monitored for symptoms and tested, as needed.  “We are deeply saddened today to learn that a fellow Texan has died from COVID-19,” said Gov. Greg Abbott. “The First Lady and I send our deepest condolences and prayers to the family and loved ones during their time of mourning. The State of Texas remains vigilant in our efforts to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus and will continue to do all we can to protect our most vulnerable populations and ensure that Texans have access to testing and treatment resources.”  People who are 65 or older or who have an underlying health condition like heart disease, lung disease, diabetes, high blood pressure or cancer have a higher risk of developing severe disease if they do get COVID-19. The safest thing for them during an outbreak is to stay home as much as possible and minimize close contact with other people. People in those groups who get sick should contact a health care provider as soon as possible and follow their instructions.  “A death in Texas shows the gravity of the situation,” said Dr. John Hellerstedt, DSHS commissioner. “It’s critically important for us all to take actions that will help protect our most vulnerable citizens. By working together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 and help ensure the health care system will be able to care for those who need it most.”  There are things everyone should do to help prevent the spread of COVID-19:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then wash your hands.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  Public health officials are further advising residents to limit their risk of exposure by avoiding large gatherings and crowded places, practicing good personal hygiene, and continuing their own preparations in case they need to stay home for two weeks. DSHS also urges people to follow the advice of local leaders for other community actions that will help stop the spread of the disease.  DSHS is posting the latest information, guidance for the public, health care providers and others, and updating case counts daily at www.dshs.texas.gov/coronavirus.      -30-    (News Media Contact: Chris Van Deusen, DSHS Director of Media Relations, 512-776-7119)  '"

       "'Coronavirus in Texas is prompting major event cancellations, the extension of college spring breaks and a handful of school closures as the number of cases surpasses 30. Also, health officials say they may have identified at least one case of the virus being spread through the community.  Here’s what you need to know.  How many people in Texas have coronavirus?  There have been at least 34 confirmed cases of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus, in Texas.  The largest numbers of cases have largely been centered in the Houston area, in North Texas and at a federal quarantine site in San Antonio.  Is coronavirus spreading person to person in Texas?  Yes. A Frisco man who traveled to California passed the virus to his wife and 3-year-old child. His relatives’ positive tests were publicly disclosed March 10. And officials in Montgomery County said March 11 they had identified a patient with coronavirus who doesn\\'t have any recent travel history, meaning community spread of the disease could be in Texas. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines community spread as the “occurrence of cases for which the source of infection is unknown.”  Dallas County’s second case was a person in their 50s who \"is a close contact\" of a 77-year-old “out-of-state traveler.” Both Dallas County cases were disclosed March 10. County officials said they expected the second person\\'s coronavirus test to come back positive and “there is not a cause for concern.\"  The first instance of coronavirus spreading from person to person in the U.S. occurred in January, when a 60-year-old woman from Illinois contracted the virus in China and transferred the virus to her spouse, according to the CDC.  Are school districts closing?  Yes, but only temporarily so far. As of March 11, at least two Texas public school districts in areas near confirmed coronavirus cases have already temporarily canceled classes.  What are colleges and universities doing?  More than a dozen Texas universities have announced that they would extend students\\' spring breaks and would at least temporarily switch to online classes. Trinity University is transitioning to remote teaching for the remainder of the spring semester and permanently closing residence halls beginning March 16. Texas Tech University has canceled classes the week after its spring break and said teaching will move online beginning March 30. Rice University canceled in-person classes for the week of March 9 after an employee, one of several Houston-area residents who had been on a contaminated cruise in Egypt, tested positive for the virus.  Many colleges and universities have canceled events, prohibited large gatherings, stepped up their sanitation measures and restricted university-sponsored travel.  Have there been major event cancellations in Texas?  Yes. South by Southwest — an annual international festival that attracts hundreds of thousands of people to the state\\'s capital — was canceled after Austin and Travis County officials issued local disaster declarations. That is one of the state\\'s biggest cancellations of conferences, major events or festivals in response to COVID-19. The 10-day event was scheduled to begin March 13.  Houston officials also decided March 11 to cancel the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo amid a seven-day emergency health declaration. On the same day, San Antonio officials said the Fiesta San Antonio Commission has no plans to cancel the weeklong Fiesta celebration in April because the event date is too far away, but they will be taking extra precautions.  And the University of Texas at Austin\\'s home sporting events will be played without fans in attendance through March 22. Its athletics teams will continue to \"travel to road competitions as scheduled at this time,\" according to the department\\'s website. The National Collegiate Athletic Association said men\\'s and women\\'s college basketball tournaments in March will not be open to the public.  What’s the latest at Texas’ federal quarantine site in San Antonio?  The state’s first 11 cases were people who caught the COVID-19 disease overseas and were quarantined at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.  Since February, hundreds of American evacuees from China’s Hubei province, the epicenter of the illness’ outbreak, and two cruise ships have stayed on the base during their quarantine periods.  The 11 people who tested positive while in quarantine were sent to San Antonio’s Texas Center for Infectious Disease for isolated treatment. Ten of those people remained there as of March 10.  Almost 100 people from a cruise ship arrived at Lackland to be quarantined on March 10, after the initial hundreds of evacuees who tested negative had been allowed to leave. San Antonio City Manager Erik Walsh said there are 120 more people expected to come to Lackland from the same cruise ship on March 11. But people who aren\\'t from Texas are being rerouted to their home states, the San Antonio Express-News reported, in what it called a “last-minute change of plans” that has flustered officials throughout the government.  How does coronavirus compare with the flu?  Coronavirus comes with seasonal flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Severe cases of the virus can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure. It also can be deadly for a small percentage of the population, according to the World Health Organization.  Similar to respiratory illnesses like the flu, coronavirus spreads from person-to-person contact, such as coughing, sneezing or touching infected surfaces, according to the CDC. Both diseases are especially dangerous for people who are older than 65, but the flu is more dangerous for children and pregnant women, according to The New York Times.  However, early reports indicate the coronavirus appears to be more contagious and have a higher fatality rate than the flu. Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine available to prevent or reduce cases of coronavirus.  How long does it take for symptoms to start showing?  The time between catching COVID-19 and showing symptoms — the incubation period — ranges from one to 14 days, most commonly five days, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO plans to update that estimate as more information is gathered.  What’s the fatality rate for coronavirus?  \"Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said March 4. The seasonal flu has a mortality rate of about 0.1%.  According to a paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, the fatality rates for the elderly or people with other underlying health conditions can be much higher — as high as 14% for people over the age of 80.  It is important to note that it is very early and data is still being gathered, so the fatality rate for COVID-19 could change, according to PBS NewsHour.'"

       "'AUSTIN (CBSDFW.COM/AP) — A Texas man who tested positive for COVID-19 has died, becoming the state’s first coronavirus-related death.  The Matagorda County Emergency Operation Center said in a news release that a male patient in his late 90s, who had symptoms consistent with the virus, died Sunday evening. Officials say the patient was a resident of Matagorda County — about 90 miles southwest of Houston.  “Our hearts and prayers go out to the family,” the statement said.  The Houston Department of Health and Human Services notified hospital officials of a positive COVID-19 test result that may be linked to the earlier positive case in Matagorda County. Medical leaders say the state has launched an extensive investigation into the case.  The positive cases come as Dallas and Houston closed bars and clubs, standardized tests for more than 3 million public schoolchildren were canceled and Republican Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday told the public to brace for a surge in coronavirus cases as the outbreak continued to dramatically reshape life in Texas.  “We are at a pivot point in the trajectory of the virus. History will say that we prioritized human life,” said Harris County Judge Lina Hidalgo, the top county official in Houston. “It will say that if we erred, we erred on the side of action.”  There are also warnings the number of COVID-19 cases would skyrocket as Texas races toward a goal of testing 10,000 people by the end of this week.  On Monday, it was Dallas and Houston taking the biggest actions yet, limiting restaurants to take-out or delivery service and putting new restrictions on other parts of daily life. Dallas officials prohibited community gatherings of more than 50 people and and ordered gyms and theaters shut for seven days.  In Houston, restaurants will be limited to takeout for 15 days. Officials said the decision was driven, in part, by still seeing large crowds of people this past weekend in the nation’s fourth-largest city.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with preexisting health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia.  The vast majority of people recover from the virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild cases recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe ones may take three to six weeks to get well.

       "'Editor\\'s note: As of May 21, this story is no longer being updated. Here\\'s where you can get the latest information:  Gov. Greg Abbott has declared a statewide public health disaster as the new coronavirus continues spreading through Texas communities and the number of cases is expected to increase exponentially.  Following the lead of national leaders to extend the period of social distancing, Abbott issued an executive order March 31 that told Texans to stay home in April except for essential activity. On May 1, that order expired and Abbott allowed restaurants, retail outlets, malls and movie theaters to reopen at reduced capacity. As of May 18, barbershops, hair and tanning salons, child care facilities and other businesses can operate under certain restrictions.  Abbott and local officials have taken several steps to buttress the medical response needed to handle the growing number of Texas cases, including calling in the National Guard to help with various health care needs. But the state economy and budget have taken a dramatic hit with businesses closing and people staying home to stop the virus\\' spread.  The Texas Tribune has received hundreds of reader questions about COVID-19. We\\'re answering what we can below. Send us your questions here.  The latest coronavirus updates  What does the pandemic mean for me?  What does this mean for my community?  What is the government doing?  What is the coronavirus?  How many people in Texas have coronavirus?  The Department of State Health Services reports daily data on the number of cases in Texas. On March 24, the agency said it changed its reporting system to track case counts directly from counties instead of relying on official case forms, which come in later and were causing the state’s official count to lag hundreds behind other tallies.  How do I get or give help?  There are a variety of resources for people who need help — or want to help. We\\'ve compiled a list here.  What is the state\\'s testing capacity, and how do I know if I should get screened?  Texas\\' testing has lagged behind the rates at which people in other states are being screened for the new coronavirus, but the state is increasing its testing capacity. Many who have gotten tests are waiting days on end, and sometimes a week or more, for the results, according to interviews with patients and health care professionals.  We\\'ve compiled a guide to how testing in Texas works, whether people qualify, how much it costs, what typical symptoms look like and everything we know about how the virus spreads. You can visit our guide here.  Are Texans allowed to leave their homes?  In an effort to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, Abbott told Texans to stay at home in April unless they were taking part in essential services and activities. Residents faced potential fines and jail time if they didn\\'t comply with the governor\\'s order, but law enforcement officers across the state primarily focused on education and issuing warnings.  Abbott let the stay-at-home order expire on May 1, letting certain businesses reopen. The state began the second phase of reopenings on May 18, allowing child care facilities, gyms and a variety of other establishments to reopen under certain restrictions. Abbott said the next round of reopenings will occur May 31, including youth summer camps and professional sports without spectators.  When do schools open back up?  At his April 17 press conference, Abbott said schools would be closed through the end of the school year. More than a month later, Abbott said Texas public school districts can offer summer school starting June 1. In-person attendance must be optional and students can not meet in groups larger than 11, according to guidance from the Texas Education Agency.  As they face millions in lost revenue, leaders of multiple large Texas universities have announced plans to resume at least some in-person classes in the fall. Texas A&M and Texas Tech both told the Tribune they are planning to play football. The University of Texas of Austin said it will reopen as scheduled in the fall, but the semester will end by Thanksgiving.  Can I still go to church?  Some churches have switched over to livestreaming their services. But technically, yes. Abbott said in his March 31 executive order that churches can remain open as long as services follow the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\\'s guidelines, such as keeping attendees at least 6 feet apart.  What things can parents do to help protect our children?  The CDC recommends children take the same preventive measures as adults: washing hands, avoiding contact with those who are sick and staying up to date on vaccinations. They note there is no evidence that children are more susceptible to the virus than adults, and in China, the majority of cases — and the majority of severe symptoms — have occurred in adults.  How is the new coronavirus impacting Texas\\' health care systems?  Hospitals are restricting who may visit and screening outsiders for fever. Some are asking doctors and nurses to work longer hours. Others are building drive-thru testing sites, temporary triage centers and fever clinics in anticipation of high patient volumes. And all of them are urging Texans to stay as isolated as possible to slow the spread of the new coronavirus because there aren’t enough hospital beds to care for critical patients if too many people get sick at once.  Many nurses and doctors on the front lines of fighting the coronavirus pandemic don\\'t qualify for the expanded paid sick leave protections that Congress granted in March to workers at small businesses. A national shortage of personal protective equipment has spurred fear among Texas health care workers that they may have to battle the worst of the new coronavirus outbreak without the masks, gowns and gloves needed to keep them safe.  Some small, rural Texas hospitals say they have so little protective gear that it could be exhausted in hours by even a few COVID-19 patients. Even bigger hospitals, which say their supplies are sufficient for now, don’t know how they will be able to replenish stocks as patient counts grow. Meanwhile, several businesses, from fabric shops to factories, are racing to make and manufacture personal protective equipment in Texas before supplies run out.  How has the coronavirus impacted nursing homes and state supported living centers?  Hundreds of staffers and residents have tested positive for the coronavirus, and dozens have died in Texas nursing homes, which care for some of the people most vulnerable to the virus.  Many nursing homes that previously had long records of citations related to poor infection control are facing major clusters of people with the coronavirus. At one nursing home with an outbreak, a doctor prescribed an unproven drug to treat many of the patients who have tested positive.  In addition, people close to state supported living centers worry that the state is responding too slowly to prevent outbreaks among people with developmental disabilities living in the 13 state-run facilities in Texas. Texas said it would test every resident and staff member in nursing homes, but residents and patients in the state-run centers will only be tested if they are symptomatic or have potentially been exposed.  How will the state\\'s economy be affected?  Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar said April 7 that the state economy is in a recession, but exact figures of the economic hit the state and its residents will take aren\\'t yet known. The answer largely depends on how long the pandemic lasts. The information that is available so far suggests the economic impact will be bad, both for the state economy as a whole and for Texans whose jobs have been affected.  Large industries that help power the Texas economy — like the oil and gas sector and airlines — are facing dramatic revenue drops, especially after the price for a barrel of oil went negative for the first time April 20. Experts also fear COVID-19 will hurt trade in the state. The comptroller said the state will be able to cover spending for the rest of the year, but the state budget will also likely have to be adjusted downward by \"several billion dollars.\"  More than 1.8 million Texans have filed for unemployment since Gov. Abbott first declared a statewide emergency. While the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics said the state had a 4.7% unemployment rate for March, analysts say the rate could be greater than 10%.  What measures are being taken to reopen the Texas economy?  Abbott announced a series of executive orders meant to restart the Texas economy during an April 17 press conference, including loosening restrictions on nonessential surgeries, retail stores and state parks. Abbott also formed a \"statewide strike force,” which will oversee a phased reopening of Texas and develop plans to restart the economy.  Hospitals began performing nonessential surgeries again April 22, but they are not allowed to deplete personal protective equipment and must keep at least 25% of their capacity available for patients with COVID-19. State parks reopened April 20 with restrictions on visitors, including a requirement to wear a mask and a limit on gatherings of more than five people.  After Abbott signed an executive order on April 27, some retail stores, restaurants, movie theaters and malls reopened at 25% capacity on May 1 even if local officials ordered them closed. On May 8, barbershops, hair and tanning salons were allowed to reopen under certain restrictions. If Texas doesn\\'t see a \"flare up of COVID-19,\" Abbott said more business reopenings could come as soon as May 18.  How is the coronavirus impacting court hearings and prisons?  Hundreds of inmates and guards have tested positive for the coronavirus. The prisons where people have tested positive for the virus are locked down until 14 days after a positive test.  Some Texans are stuck in jail because many court proceedings have been paused, including jury trials and plea deal hearings. Some local officials have moved to release low-level defendants accused of nonviolent crimes from jails, which are especially vulnerable to the spread of COVID-19. As of May 2, more than 70% of Texas prisoners tested had positive results for the coronavirus. On May 12, the state announced widespread testing of state prisoners for the new coronavirus.  Abbott signed an order March 29 that prohibits inmates accused or previously convicted of violent crimes from being released from jails if they can’t pay bail, while inmates who can pay bail can walk free. A state judge blocked the order on April 10 after Harris County judges, the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas and other criminal defense organizations challenged it as an overreach of Abbott’s executive power and for unconstitutionally discriminating against poor defendants. However, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in favor of the order.  In a separate lawsuit, two older Texas inmates say the Texas Department of Criminal Justice is failing to protect prisoners at a geriatric prison near College Station, prompting a federal judge to issue a temporary order April 16 requiring the prison to provide hand sanitizer and face masks to inmates. After the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the federal judge\\'s order, inmates filed their appeal with the Supreme Court on May 4.  How has the coronavirus impacted the upcoming elections?  Texas election officials are considering how to safely host voters at the ballot boxes — if voters will even show up for the July 14 primary runoff election. Gov. Greg Abbott extended the early voting period for the upcoming election so it will begin June 29 instead of July 6 so “election officials can implement appropriate social distancing and safe hygiene practices.”  Local administrators are considering a variety of options, including expanding curbside voting, adding sanitizing and protective gear and implementing plexiglass or plastic shields at polling place check-in stations. But they’re not sure if they can expand one tactic embraced by many other states — voting by mail.  Individual Texas voters, Democrats and civil rights organizations have asked state and federal courts to allow Texans to vote by mail in July. In mid-April, one Travis County district judge ruled in favor of providing absentee ballots to voters who cite their risk of exposure to the coronavirus as a disability under the Texas election code.  As the courts consider the litany of legal challenges, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton has asked the Texas Supreme Court to tell local officials to follow his interpretation that fear of contracting the coronavirus isn\\'t a legally valid reason for voters to request absentee ballots. The Texas Supreme Court put the ruling on hold after a state appeals court upheld the district judge’s order. The U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals also temporarily blocked a federal district judge’s ruling, which would have allowed for anyone in Texas who wants to avoid transmission of the virus to qualify for a mail-in ballot.  What is the government doing to help those financially impacted?  Congress\\' CARES Act will cost more than $2 trillion and aims to support the medical response to the pandemic, keep businesses afloat long enough to avoid more layoffs and give money to Americans making less than a certain income. The legislation also expands unemployment insurance and suspends payments of federally backed student loans.  The Texas Public Utility Commission has banned utilities from cutting off power and water services to Texans who have lost jobs and income during the COVID-19 crisis at least through mid-September. Several local governments have also issued various orders that prohibit cutting off certain utilities. Check with your local government agency to see what orders have been put in place.  To help renters, especially those who have been laid off or whose hours have been cut, the Texas Supreme Court issued an order halting eviction proceedings statewide until May 18. At the end of the period, the chief justice can choose to renew the order. Several cities and counties have also issued eviction moratoriums that may extend past the statewide order. Check with your city or county officials for details.  Texas is providing $50 million in loans to small businesses, Abbott said April 13. The U.S. Small Business Administration previously offered $350 billion in long-term, low-interest loans for small-business owners, but the funds dried up April 16 after two weeks. On April 23, Congress temporarily replenished the federal small-business fund with $320 billion.  As part of the Pandemic Electronic Benefit Transfer program, the federal government has also given Texas permission to distribute emergency Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program benefits to families with children eligible for free and reduced-cost school meals.  What is Texas doing to help address unemployment claims?  The number of Texans applying for unemployment relief increased by more than 1,600% over two weeks in March, which overwhelmed the Texas Workforce Commission\\'s phone lines and website and caused delays for thousands of Texas. In response, the commission hired 1,000 new employees, opened two more call centers, extended operating hours and increased server capacity.  Texas has also relaxed requirements for state unemployment benefits by removing the work search requirement and declining to reduce future benefits for people who have been overpaid. However, the executive director of the Texas Workforce Commission told lawmakers the work-search requirements may be reinstated once restaurants and retail stores can open at 50% capacity. While the unemployment benefits don’t apply to all Texans, including people who are self-employed or work on a contract basis, many of them can seek relief through the federal coronavirus aid bill.  What’s the fatality rate for coronavirus?  \"Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected,\" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said March 3. The seasonal flu has a mortality rate of about 0.1%.  According to a paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, the fatality rates for the elderly or people with other underlying health conditions can be much higher — as high as 14% for people over the age of 80.  It is important to note that data is still being gathered, so the fatality rate for COVID-19 could change, according to PBS NewsHour.  How does the coronavirus spread?  The virus spreads primarily through droplets from an infected person who coughs or sneezes, according to the WHO. It may be spread by people who are asymptomatic or through surfaces with the virus on it, but this is not believed to be the main mode of transmission, according to the CDC.  To prevent the spread, the CDC recommends regularly washing your hands, avoiding contact with people who are sick and practicing social distancing.  How long does the virus live on surfaces?  Studies suggest it may last for a few hours or up to several days, depending on the type of surface and the temperature and humidity of the room, according to the WHO. Tests by the U.S. government and scientists found it can last up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.  How long does it take for symptoms to start showing?  The time between catching the coronavirus and showing symptoms — the incubation period — ranges from one to 14 days, most commonly five days, according to the WHO. The WHO plans to update that estimate as more information is gathered.  Who is most at risk?  Research shows the people most at risk are elderly and those with serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes or lung disease, according to the CDC.  There isn’t enough data yet to determine the risk for pregnant women, but researchers hope to gather information on risk for these women, the likelihood of sickness compared with women who aren\\'t pregnant and whether the virus passes from mother to baby.  For now, Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrics and epidemiology professor with University of Florida Health, advises pregnant women, like everyone else, to “avoid being exposed — stay away from sick people, wash hands frequently, avoid touching their face and disinfect contaminated surfaces.\"  What do social distancing, community spread and pandemic really mean?  Social distancing is deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Staying at least 6 feet away, working from home and avoiding crowds will help stop or slow the spread of the virus and put less strain on health care resources, or “flatten the curve”.  Community spread is when someone becomes infected without having contact with another infected person or traveling to an area where the infection was documented.  According to the CDC, an epidemic is an outbreak of a disease beyond what the population in an area usually expects. A pandemic is when an epidemic spreads to multiple countries or continents. On March 11, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.  Edgar Walters contributed to this report.'"

       "'Two more cases of the new strain of coronavirus have been confirmed at the San Antonio military base where some evacuees from a cruise ship were quarantined Monday, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention said at a press conference Friday. This brings the number of confirmed Texas cases of the strain named COVID-19 to three.  The two evacuees were among 329 Americans repatriated against the CDC\\'s recommendation after disembarking from the Diamond Princess off of Japan. Another 16 cruise ship evacuees quarantined in California and Nebraska have also been confirmed to have coronavirus.  \"[The passengers] are considered at high risk for infection, and we do expect to see additional confirmed cases of COVID-19 among the passengers,\" said Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, during the press conference.  There are also several Americans hospitalized in Japan who are \"seriously ill,\" she said.  The first Texas case was confirmed Feb. 13 when one of 91 Americans evacuated from the Hubei province of China, the epicenter of the outbreak, was hospitalized. The remaining 90 Americans were released from the San Antonio base Thursday because they showed no symptoms after a 14-day quarantine.  The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a public health emergency by last month. According to the latest CDC report, there are over 75,000 confirmed cases worldwide, and the death toll has surpassed 2,000. But outside of China, there have been only three fatalities, and none in the U.S.  The total number of confirmed U.S. cases is 34. However, the CDC makes a distinction between cases among repatriated Americans and all other U.S. cases, as the former aren\\'t an accurate representation of how the virus is spreading within the country, according to Messonnier.  \"We don\\'t yet have a vaccine for this novel virus, nor do we have a medicine to treat it specifically,\" Messonnier said.  The goal now is to slow the introduction of the virus into the U.S. to buy time to prepare the community for more cases and possibly sustained spread, she added.  Two elderly Japanese passengers aboard the Diamond Princess died after testing positive for the virus, Japan\\'s health minister said Thursday.  Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin are working on a vaccine, and a Houston-based genetic engineering company announced this week it finished developing one. However, the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved a vaccine.

       "'Note: All statistics in this story are current as of 11:15 p.m. Aug. 15 and will be updated regularly.  Health authorities are closely watching an outbreak of respiratory illness caused by a new strain of coronavirus known as COVID-19. Here are the answers to key questions about the outbreak:  What is the new virus?  Scientists have identified the virus as a novel, or new, coronavirus. The name comes from the Latin word for crowns or halos, which coronaviruses resemble under a microscope. The coronavirus family has many strains that affect people. Some cause the common cold, while some originating in bats, camels and other animals have evolved into more severe illnesses such as SARS — severe acute respiratory syndrome — or MERS — Middle East respiratory syndrome.  Where did it come from?  The first cases of COVID-19 appeared in Wuhan, in central China’s Hubei province. Many of the first people infected had visited or worked at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, which has since been closed for an investigation. Chinese health officials say they think the illness first spread from animals to people.  How widespread is it?  More than 21.3 million cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed around the world, according to Johns Hopkins University. The vast majority of the early cases were in China — where the rate of new cases has slowed drastically — and Brazil, India, Russia and the United States have since become hotspots. In the United States, which now has the biggest reported outbreak of any nation by far, more than 5.3 million cases have been confirmed.  Having trouble seeing this map? Click here.  How deadly is it?  More than 770,000 people have died from the virus, making the mortality rate about 3.6% among confirmed cases. By comparison, the mortality rate for the seasonal flu is generally about 0.1%. Experts say inconsistencies in reporting cases have made it difficult to precisely determine the mortality rate. Also, in some places, only the most critical patients were tested at the onset of the pandemic, and many people with mild or no symptoms may never be tested. Experts have said the virus’ true mortality rate may be closer to 1%.  What are the symptoms?  Common symptoms include fever, dry cough and fatigue. Shortness of breath, chills and body aches are associated with more dangerous cases of coronavirus, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. In serious cases, the virus can cause pneumonia. The virus and the flu have similar symptoms and transmission methods, so they can be hard to tell apart.  How is it treated?  Testing can identify the virus, but there’s no vaccine to prevent an infection. Patients with the virus have been isolated in hospitals or homes to prevent spreading it. The symptoms are treated with pain and fever medication, and people are advised to drink plenty of liquids and rest while they recover.  How is it spreading?  Many coronaviruses can spread through coughing or sneezing, or by touching an infected person. Scientists believe the new virus can spread from person to person in close contact through the respiratory tract.  What is community spread?  Most of the early local cases of COVID-19 were travel-related, but in some cases patients hadn’t been to areas where there are outbreaks. Community spread means that someone has been infected with the virus but health officials aren’t sure where or how. Social distancing aims to prevent community spread of the disease.  How long does the virus live on surfaces?  Tests by U.S. government and other scientists found that the new coronavirus can live in the air for several hours and on some surfaces — such as plastic and stainless steel — for as long as two to three days. Their work suggests people can get infected through the air as well as from touching things that were contaminated by others who have it, in addition to direct person-to-person contact.  Should you wear a mask?  Health authorities originally said that healthy people generally shouldn’t need to wear masks as protection against the coronavirus. But the CDC has since recommended that people wear cloth face coverings in public settings where it may be difficult to maintain social distancing, such as grocery stores. Surgical masks and N95 respirators should be reserved for medical workers and first responders, the CDC says. The new guidance is based on studies that show that many people infected with the coronavirus can spread it before they show symptoms, or even without ever showing symptoms.  Does hand sanitizer kill it?  Experts say frequent hand-washing with soap and water is the best way to prevent the spread of disease. Hands should be washed for at least 20 seconds after people sneeze, cough or use the restroom and before eating. If soap and water aren’t available, the CDC says hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol is an acceptable alternative.  How do you stop touching your face?  Washing your hands and not touching your face are basic prevention tips against the virus. People tend to touch their eyes, nose and mouth, places the virus can easily enter the body. To avoid this, trying using a tissue or wearing gloves, putting your hands away, setting reminders or recording yourself.  How should you prepare your home?  Experts say you should buy extra shelf-stable foods, such as rice, beans and canned goods, so you won’t need to go to the grocery store as often. Also make sure to have enough of your prescription medication on hand. For cleaning, household cleaners should be effective disinfectants.  What if someone in your home is sick?  If someone in your home has the coronavirus, you should stay home to prevent spreading the disease, health officials say. Don’t have visitors, and try to separate the sick person from healthy residents — including giving them their own bedroom and bathroom, if possible. Clean and disinfect surfaces regularly, and take extra precautions with laundry.  Will warm weather slow down the disease?  Health experts note that some viruses, like the flu, peak during the winter and slow down during the summer. It’s possible that the spread of coronavirus may be stunted by warmer weather — droplets won’t stay in the air as long after people cough or sneeze, and people will spend less time indoors, where it’s easier for person-to-person spread to occur. But experts caution that because the virus is so new, there’s a lot we don’t yet know about it.  Can you get coronavirus twice?  Reports of people testing positive for the virus after recovering from COVID-19 have occurred in places like China and Japan. Health experts told The New York Times it was unlikely that people were getting re-infected after such a short period of time. Positive tests after recovering from the virus could be blamed on testing methods. One possibility is that the test used to detect coronavirus is highly sensitive and could be picking up very small amounts of the virus. Other health experts have said that while people who recover may develop some immunity, it may not last long enough to prevent re-infection.  How many people have recovered from coronavirus?  According to data compiled by Johns Hopkins University, about 60% of all patients infected with the new coronavirus have already recovered.  The Associated Press and staff reports contributed to this report.  For more information about how Johns Hopkins University tracks coronavirus cases, visit the university’s blog post.'"

       "'Gov. Greg Abbott has declared a statewide public health disaster as community spread of the new coronavirus has hit and the number of cases is expected to increase exponentially. He issued an executive order March 19 that closes bars, gyms, schools and restaurants. Takeout is still allowed.  The Texas Tribune has received hundreds of reader questions about COVID-19. We’re answering what we can below. Send us your questions here.  How many people in Texas have coronavirus?  Daily data on the number of cases in Texas is reported by the Department of State Health Services. On March 24, the agency said it changed its reporting system to track case counts directly from counties instead of relying on official case forms, which come in later and were causing the state’s official count to lag hundreds behind other tallies.  The largest numbers of cases have mostly been centered in the Houston area, in North Texas and in San Antonio. One case has been confirmed in a Texas prison. All five of the state’s most populous urban areas have cases.  As of March 25, Texas is reporting 995 coronavirus cases.  The Texas Department of State Health Services is tracking COVID-19 cases in Texas by county. The numbers are reported by local health officials and are current as of 8 p.m. the day before. They may not represent all cases of the disease given limited testing capacity.  As of March 25 at noon, there were at least 995 coronavirus cases in Texas. There were 12 reported deaths. At least 13,235 people have been tested.  Map: Track COVID-19 cases in Texas, county-by-county updates  Have any Texans died?  Yes. There have been at least 11 coronavirus-related deaths as of March 24.  Is coronavirus spreading person to person in Texas?  Yes. That has prompted Abbott to promise more testing capacity and urge Texans to practice social distancing, something health experts and local officials have also promoted. Community spread, which the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defines as the “occurrence of cases for which the source of infection is unknown,” has prompted school districts and colleges across the state to suspend classes, move to online courses or cancel the remainder of the school year. Community spread has also spurred local officials throughout the state to prohibit in-person dining and close bars and clubs.  How will the disruptions affect the state’s economy?  Experts say it\\'s too soon to predict the full economic fallout of coronavirus\\' massive disruptions to regular life and commerce. But entire industries are facing dramatic revenue drops, and Texas business owners are already feeling the financial pain of event cancellations and social distancing. Experts also fear COVID-19 will hurt trade in the state.  Restaurant owners asked the state to waive or postpone February’s monthly sales taxes, but officials declined, citing the need for revenue to help hospitals and emergency services respond. To combat the economic devastation, Gov. Greg Abbott announced that small businesses can apply for the Economic Injury Disaster Loan, a long-term, low-interest loan from the U.S. Small Business Administration. But the commercial disruption of social distancing has raised more questions than answers for Texans whose jobs have been affected.  What’s the difference between stay-at-home orders and curfew?  Various jurisdictions have implemented their own responses to the new coronavirus, including shelter-in-place orders and curfews, after Abbott declined March 22 to order a statewide stay-at-home order.  Large counties across Texas have issued stay-at-home orders for their residents. The orders generally tell residents to leave their houses only for essential activities, such as going to the grocery store or seeing the doctor.  Instead of implementing a stay-at-home order, Hidalgo County has implemented a curfew, which also orders residents not to leave their homes except for essential services. However, unlike the orders by the larger Texas counties, the curfew applies only between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m.  What is Texas’ testing capacity?  Texas appears to be lagging behind other populous states in testing for COVID-19.  Public testing is available in San Antonio, Dallas, Austin and Houston, and Abbott promised mass testing by March 20. He said he expects the state to start testing 10,000 people weekly and is expecting 15,000 test kits from the Federal Emergency Management Agency.  How do I get tested?  A doctor can determine whether the test is necessary using guidance from the CDC. The test includes a mouth and nose swab. That sample is then sent to the nearest public health lab for testing.  The state has strict criteria for lab testing, and only certain people qualify. Texans can be tested in public health labs, private clinics or hospitals. But meeting with a doctor while exhibiting some of COVID-19’s common symptoms, like fever, cough and shortness of breath, does not guarantee you’ll be tested at one of the 10 public health labs in Texas.  The state is prioritizing high-risk patients, hospital patients with COVID-19 symptoms, health care workers who’ve been in close contact with someone who’s tested positive for the disease, and patients with recent travel history in areas that have been affected by the disease.  How does coronavirus compare with the flu?  Coronavirus comes with seasonal flu-like symptoms, including fever, cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Severe cases of the virus can lead to pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome and kidney failure. It also can be deadly for a small percentage of the population, according to the World Health Organization.  Similar to respiratory illnesses like the flu, coronavirus spreads from person-to-person contact, such as coughing, sneezing or touching infected surfaces, according to the CDC. Both diseases are especially dangerous for people who are older than 65, but the flu is more dangerous for children and pregnant women, according to The New York Times.  However, early reports indicate the coronavirus appears to be more contagious and have a higher fatality rate than the flu. Unlike the flu, there is no vaccine available to prevent or reduce cases of coronavirus.  How long does it take for symptoms to start showing?  The time between catching COVID-19 and showing symptoms — the incubation period — ranges from one to 14 days, most commonly five days, according to the World Health Organization. The WHO plans to update that estimate as more information is gathered.  What is the course of the virus? How long does it last?  It depends. Once someone is infected, he or she can face symptoms from days to weeks. Some patients show only mild symptoms, while other patients’ symptoms worsen to an infection of the lower respiratory tract. All patients should closely monitor their symptoms.  There are some risk factors for progression to more severe illness, including older age and underlying conditions like lung disease, cancer, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, diabetes, a compromised immune system and pregnancy, according to the CDC.  What’s the fatality rate for coronavirus?  \"Globally, about 3.4% of reported COVID-19 cases have died. By comparison, seasonal flu generally kills far fewer than 1% of those infected,\" WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said March 4. The seasonal flu has a mortality rate of about 0.1%.  According to a paper published by the Journal of the American Medical Association, the fatality rates for the elderly or people with other underlying health conditions can be much higher — as high as 14% for people over the age of 80.  It is important to note that it is very early and data is still being gathered, so the fatality rate for COVID-19 could change, according to PBS NewsHour.  Does the flu shot lessen the severity of coronavirus?  No. The flu shot builds up an immunity specifically to the flu, so it won’t lessen the severity of or protect from COVID-19.  But doctors are still urging people to get the flu shot in the hopes of freeing up crucial hospital beds.  How long does the virus live on surfaces?  Studies suggest it may last for a few hours or up to several days, depending on the type of surface and the temperature and humidity of the room, according to the World Health Organization. Tests by the U.S. government and scientists found it can last up to two to three days on plastic and stainless steel.  Experts advise cleaning frequently touched surfaces — like doorknobs and elevator buttons — with disinfectant and recommend that people wash their hands frequently with an alcohol-based hand sanitizer or soap and water, and avoiding touching their eyes, mouth or nose.  However, transmission of the virus from a contaminated surface to a person has not yet been recorded, according to the CDC.  What things can parents do to help protect our children?  The CDC recommends children take the same preventive measures as adults: washing hands, avoiding contact with those who are sick and staying up to date on vaccinations. They note there is no evidence children are more susceptible to the virus than adults, and in China, the majority of cases — and the majority of severe symptoms — occur in adults.  Who is most at risk?  Research shows the people most at risk are elderly and those with serious chronic medical conditions like heart disease, diabetes or lung disease, according to the CDC.  There isn’t enough data yet to determine the risk for pregnant women.  “It’s possible that pregnant women could be at increased risk based on our previous experience with influenza,” said Sonja Rasmussen, a pediatrics and epidemiology professor with University of Florida Health. “But we don’t have any data to support that right now, based on the small amount of information we have from China. More data and more careful studies will be needed for us to know for sure.”  In time, researchers hope to gather information on risk for these women, the likelihood of sickness compared with women who aren\\'t pregnant and whether the virus passes from mother to baby.  For now, Rasmussen advises pregnant women, like everyone else, to “avoid being exposed — stay away from sick people, wash hands frequently, avoid touching their face and disinfect contaminated surfaces. If you’re living in an area with widespread transmission, working from home might be the best option.”  What do social distancing, community spread and pandemic really mean?  Social distancing is deliberately increasing the physical space between people to avoid spreading illness, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Staying at least 6 feet away, working from home and avoiding crowds will help stop or slow the spread of the virus and put less strain on health care resources, or “flatten the curve”.  Community spread is when someone becomes infected without having contact with another infected person or traveling to an area where the infection was documented.  According to the CDC, an epidemic is an outbreak of a disease beyond what the population in an area usually expects. A pandemic is when an epidemic spreads to multiple countries or continents. Last week, the WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic.'"

       "'The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention is telling Americans that they should be prepared for the possibility of a COVID-19 outbreak in their community.  But what does preparedness look like in practice? The short answer: Don\\'t panic — but do prepare.  That \"means not only contingency planning but also good old-fashioned preparedness planning for your family,\" says Rebecca Katz, director of the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University. In other words, what you\\'d do in case of a possible hurricane or another natural disaster.  We spoke with Katz and other health experts about common-sense things you can do to be ready should the virus hit where you live.  Should I stock up on food and meds?  The reason to stock up on certain products now isn\\'t so much to avoid potential shortages in the event of an outbreak but to practice what experts call social distancing. Basically, you want to avoid crowds to minimize your risk of catching the disease. If COVID-19 is spreading in your community, the last place you want to be is in line at a crowded grocery store or drugstore.  If you take daily medications — for example, blood pressure pills — make sure you have enough to last a couple of weeks, suggests Katz, as long as you can get approval for an extended supply from your insurance provider.  Also worth pre-buying: fever reducers like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, says Edith Bracho-Sanchez, a pediatrician with Columbia University Medical Center.  Think about adding enough nonperishable foods to your pantry to carry you through for a couple of weeks, adds Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and a senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University\\'s Center for Health Security.  Bracho-Sanchez suggests having on hand your go-to sickbed foods, like chicken or vegetable broth and crackers in case of illness, as well as hydrating drinks such as Gatorade and Pedialyte for kids (though so far, kids seem less vulnerable to COVID-19). That\\'s because if you do get sick, you want to be ready to ride it out at home if need be. So far, 80% of COVID-19 cases have been mild. (Think cold or flu symptoms.)  Are special cleaning supplies needed?  We still don\\'t know exactly how long the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 can survive on surfaces. But Stephen Morse, a professor of epidemiology at Columbia University Medical Center, says what we know from other coronaviruses is that most household cleansers — such as bleach wipes or alcohol — will kill them.  Even wiping down surfaces with soap and water should do the trick, he says, because this coronavirus has a lipid envelope around it — like a coat that keeps the RNA inside the viral particle. And soap is a detergent that can break down lipids. \"We use them to take grease and oil, which is a lipid, off our dishes,\" he notes.  If COVID-19 does start circulating in your community or there\\'s someone sick at home, plan on cleaning surfaces that get touched frequently — such as kitchen counters and bathroom faucets — several times a day, says Dr. Trish Perl, chief of the infectious disease division at UT Southwestern Medical Center. That advice, she says, comes from studies on other diseases \"where they\\'ve shown that if you do clean up the environment, you can actually decrease the amount of virus that is on hard surfaces significantly.\"  What about face masks?  The science on whether it\\'s helpful to wear a face mask out in public is really, really mixed, as we\\'ve reported in depth. (For starters, it depends on what kind of mask you are wearing and whether you use it correctly.)  Some infectious disease experts are reluctant to recommend that people wear masks as a preventive measure because they can provide a false sense of security.  What experts do agree on is that wearing a mask is a good idea if you are sick, so you can reduce the chances that you\\'ll infect others, whether it\\'s family members at home or people at the doctor\\'s office if you go in to be seen. Perl says that wearing a mask when sick is especially a good idea if you live with someone whose immune system is compromised or who\\'s elderly, since people in their 60s and above seem to be the most vulnerable to COVID-19.  Some research suggests that wearing a mask can help protect you if you\\'re caring for a sick family member, but only if you wear it all the time in the presence of the sick person and if you are careful not to touch the front of it, which could be contaminated with pathogens.  What to do about work — and telecommuting?  Now is the time to talk to your boss about your ability to work from home if COVID-19 is spreading locally, says Morse. Obviously, if you\\'re sick, you should stay home. But even if you are well, telecommuting makes sense in the event of a local outbreak to reduce the chances that you\\'ll be infected.  \"That might be the prudent thing for many people to do if they\\'re able to do it,\" he says, especially in big cities like New York, where large crowds of people are concentrated on public transport.  What\\'s the plan if you get sick?  If you show early signs of illness — like a fever or a dry cough — Bracho-Sanchez says you should call your doctor\\'s office but don\\'t necessarily head straight to the emergency room or urgent care, where you might infect others.  \"Do you really need to come into the office? Can we work this out through the phone?\" Bracho-Sanchez says. \"Of course, if you\\'re having trouble breathing, if you\\'re dehydrated, that\\'s a different story.\"  Do you have a plan for kids and older relatives?  Perl and Katz suggest you start figuring out now what you would do if day care centers or schools start closing because of an outbreak. Do you have a backup child care plan in place?  \"Having a plan for these kinds of eventualities now — instead of like it happened in China, where one minute things were open and the next minute they weren\\'t — can be very helpful and a lot less disruptive,\" Perl says.  \"For example, for me, I\\'m trying to think about, what if my mother gets sick? She doesn\\'t live in Dallas,\" where Perl is. \"What am I going to do? How am I going to get her cared for?\"  Perl says it would be wise to reach out now to friends or neighbors who might be able to help in such situations.  Are there any habits I can practice at home to stay healthy?  Bracho-Sanchez suggests everyone in the house start a new habit today: Wash your hands as soon as you walk through the door.  You\\'ve heard it over and over, but one of the best ways to protect yourself against infection from COVID-19 — or cold or flu, for that matter – is good old-fashioned hand hygiene. Washing your hands frequently, as well as avoiding touching your face, eyes and nose, is a tried-and-true way to cut down on respiratory infections, Perl says.  Studies have shown that \"good hand-washing and frequent hand-washing will decrease the risk of transmission of these viruses anywhere from 30 to 50 percent,\" she says. \"You can use the alcohol-based hand gels, or you can use soap and water. It doesn\\'t need to be any kind of antibacterial soap.\" And you should scrub your hands for at least 20 seconds — about as long as it takes to sing the \"Happy Birthday\" song twice.  Also, if you\\'re not already doing it, start practicing good respiratory etiquette: Cough into your elbow instead of spewing virus-laden particles into the air (and wash your hands right after), and make sure to throw out your used tissues, since they might have virus particles on them.  \"Those are very, very effective kinds of measures just in terms of decreasing exposure of others,\" says Perl.

       "'Texas officials have been taking steps for the last month to prepare for the potential spread of the novel coronavirus COVID-19, Gov. Greg Abbott said.  Abbott spoke Thursday after getting briefed by public health and other state officials. He said he also spoke with Vice President Mike Pence, who is coordinating the response effort at the national level.  While the state began taking steps to prepare a response to the respiratory illness about a month ago, Abbott said it is drawing on historical knowledge responding to other infectious diseases.  “Long story short: There’s a tremendous amount of work that all of these state agencies, the state health leaders and emergency response leaders, have put in for well over a month now ... but they did not start from the beginning a month ago,\" he said. \"They built upon knowledge gained in response to the Ebola challenge, and the H1N1 [swine flu] challenge.”  The Texas Department of State Health Services (DSHS) is leading the effort to respond to the illness here. Abbott said the agency is in close communication with a number of agencies, including the Texas Division of Emergency Management, the Texas Education Agency and the Texas Commission on Jail Standards.  DSHS Commissioner John Hellerstedt said the state has been given the green light to validate kits to detect the coronavirus at the state lab in Austin and at members of the Laboratory Response Network. Test kits are being made available to local laboratories through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  DSHS is holding daily calls with public health authorities and health care providers to ensure information is getting from the state to local providers.  \"These calls have included 500-600 people per call, and they began on Jan. 24,\" Abbott said.  He said DSHS has produced guidance documents to be used by state agencies to ensure consistent messaging on the state response to COVID-19 and is sending documents to school districts on how to promote good hygiene.  On Wednesday, Sen. Ted Cruz, who chairs the Subcommittee on Aviation and Space, announced he will convene a hearing March 4 on how airlines can help contain and combat the spread of the illness.  Texas has already been at the forefront of federal efforts to contain the coronavirus. Earlier this month, Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport became one of 11 airports in the U.S. to receive flights carrying passengers from China.  Chad Wolf, the acting head of the Department of Homeland Security, said in a statement that funneling travelers through fewer airports “is the most important and prudent step we can take at this time to decrease the strain on public health officials.”  Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio is also one of a handful of military installations being used to quarantine U.S. citizens returning from China. Lackland received its first group of evacuees – 91 – from Hubei Province earlier this month. Of that group, only one person tested positive for the illness. The initial group of evacuees who tested negative were released from the 14-day quarantine last week.  Last week, Lackland received a second wave of evacuees from the Diamond Princess cruise ship, where there had been an outbreak of coronavirus. The 144 people in that group remain under quarantine and eight have been diagnosed with COVID-19.  According to Texas Public Radio, one man who tested positive for the infection and was isolated at the Texas Center for Infectious Diseases has been reunited with his wife, who is quarantined at the National Quarantine Center in Nebraska. There are now 145 people at Lackland, Rear Adm. Nancy Knight said Thursday.  There are no other known cases of the coronavirus in Texas.'"

       "'Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Monday called the federal government\\'s response to the coronavirus \"unacceptable\" after a Texas woman was released from quarantine before health officials learned she had tested positive for the virus.  \"What happened in San Antonio and what the CDC did is completely unacceptable,\" Abbott said to reporters Monday morning at the Governor\\'s Mansion in Austin during a news conference on economic development.  \"It appears to be a case of negligence with regard to how this person, who had the coronavirus, could leave TCID [Texas Center for Infectious Disease] and go back into the general population. I think they understand the magnitude of the error they made.\"  The woman tested positive for the illness last month after she was evacuated from Wuhan, China, but was released from quarantine Saturday following two negative tests, officials said. After the woman\\'s release, health officials learned that a third lab test came back \"weakly positive.\"  A shopping mall in San Antonio was shut down on Monday, after a woman who tested negative for Coronavirus twice was released from quarantine, then a third test came back positive for the virus. North Star Mall will be closed for 24 hours as crews clean the mall.  \"Every possible action that can be taken is being undertaken to make sure her exposure to anybody in San Antonio is minimized,\" Abbott said.  Meanwhile, more than 120 passengers from the Diamond Princess cruise ship who had been in quarantine in San Antonio were scheduled for release Monday, Mayor Ron Nirenberg said. The mayor and other officials in San Antonio called for a third lab test for the passengers before they are released.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) on Monday called the federal government’s response to the coronavirus “unacceptable” after a Texas woman was released from quarantine before health officials learned she had tested positive for the virus. Video courtesy: KXAN  The woman who tested positive was out of quarantine for about 12 hours and went to a hotel and a shopping mall, said Dr. Anita Kurian, assistant director of San Antonio Metropolitan Health Department.  Kurian said officials consider the exposure risk for people at the mall and hotel to be low, noting that the woman spent much of her time sitting alone at the mall\\'s food court. Two people who encountered her at the hospital are at a medium risk, she said.  Nirenberg said Monday that it was \"totally unacceptable\" that the woman was released from quarantine.  \"We simply cannot have a screw-up like this from our federal partners,\" he said.  There are 11 patients being treated in Texas who have mild symptoms of coronavirus, Abbott said.  How to Avoid COVID-19 Infection:  The best way to prevent infection is to take precautions to avoid exposure to this virus, which are similar to the precautions you take to avoid the flu. CDC always recommends these everyday actions to help prevent the spread of respiratory viruses, including:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer.  Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands.  Avoid close contact with people who are sick.  Stay home when you are sick.  Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash.  Clean and disinfect frequently touched objects and surfaces.  *Information shared from the Office of Texas Gov. Greg Abbott'"

       "'State and federal officials on Thursday said 10 people who have tested positive for the new coronavirus are under observation in a San Antonio facility.  The details were shared during a briefing at the State Operations Center in North Austin in which Gov. Greg Abbott went over the different measures state officials are taking in preparation for the possibility of an outbreak of the virus in Texas.  Health officials have said the threat of a Texas outbreak remains low, but Abbott said the state is preparing for all possible outcomes.  \"Planning includes different scenarios ranging from the status quo to extreme pandemic so we can be prepared for anything that may happen,\" he said.  Abbott and other officials said all of the patients in the San Antonio treatment facility are either evacuees from Wuhan, China, or were passengers aboard a cruise ship where a coronavirus outbreak had occurred in Japan earlier this month.  The individuals infected with the virus were quarantined immediately after arriving in the United States and haven’t had contact with other Texas residents, said Nancy Knight, director of the Division of Global Health Protection at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Knight said eight of the 10 patients in the San Antonio facility were among the 145 U.S. citizens evacuated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship. The two other patients had been in Wuhan and were also quarantined immediately after arriving in the U.S. They are all in isolation and in various stages of recovery, Knight said.  The Texas Department of State Health Services set up 22 negative pressure rooms, sealed off from the rest of the facility, to treat the patients at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease in San Antonio.  The new coronavirus has caused a global health scare with more than 81,000 cases confirmed internationally. Illnesses linked to the virus first broke out in the industrial city of Wuhan in China’s Hubei province. Travelers from Wuhan entering the United States have been placed under mandatory federal quarantine.  The CDC on Thursday confirmed 871 new cases globally within a 24-hour period.  In the United States, the CDC said they confirmed 14 cases of the virus. Of those, 12 cases were travel-related while two infections were spread person-to-person.  The CDC has tested 445 people in the U.S. for the disease so far, according to data updated Thursday.  Abbott said Texas officials are checking in regularly with the White House and the CDC to provide updates on those infected in Texas.  Abbott said the Texas Department of State Health Services is the lead agency responding to the new coronavirus and is working closely with other agencies to coordinate and plan for the state’s response to the global health scare.  Health officials are also working to inform the community about signs and symptoms of the virus, so residents know when to notify their local health departments if their symptoms match those of COVID-19. They are also in contact with commercial travelers returning from China to report their temperatures and other symptoms daily, Abbott said.  The Department of State Health Services is also working to ensure high-risk populations, like children, elderly people and those in health care facilities, know how to mitigate coronavirus and complete proper disinfectant measures.  \"Long story short, there is a tremendous amount of work at all these state agencies, health leaders and emergency response leaders, have put in for well over a month now to be extremely well organized,\" Abbott said. \"We have an extremely robust, well informed, activated force prepared for any potential outcome that we may have to deal with.\"'"

       "'Texas officials are scrambling to remain prepared for a major outbreak of a pneumonia-like disease whose global spread one expert says is now moving into “the next phase.”  From the governor’s office to hospitals to state agencies, Texas officials are intensifying efforts to plan for scenarios that could unfold now that the coronavirus is no longer relatively contained to China and surrounding countries and the number of cases is soaring in countries in Europe and the Middle East.  “I think we need to call an audible,” said Peter Hotez, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine and Texas Children’s Hospital. “We need to refresh the algorithms about who’s at risk and when we should suspect someone has the virus. We’re not calling it an epidemic yet, but we should start operating as if it were.”  Hotez said the disease’s spread — the number of cases in Italy and Iran, now about 900, more than doubled in two days, for instance — has made basing screening on the individual’s travel history less relevant. He also noted some recent cases have been characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms rather than respiratory symptoms.  The virus, which originated in Wuhan, China, in early January but has now spread to 48 countries, has been diagnosed in 82,000 people and caused nearly 3,000 deaths, most involving elderly people or those with underlying serious conditions. Most people experience mild symptoms and make full recoveries.  Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sought to reassure the public Thursday, noting that state agencies have been working on the matter for a month “using historical knowledge gained from responses to other infectious disease emergencies.” But he also announced a number of new preparedness steps — such as for the Texas Division of Emergency Management to begin holding biweekly meetings with state agencies starting next week and for the division to convene working groups with experts to inform response plans.  He also said the Texas Department of State Health Services is preparing state laboratories to administer tests for the virus, known as COVID-19. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, which has the only test for the virus, is expected to mail kits soon to local and state health agencies to conduct their own testing, after previous ones it sent out early this month proved faulty.  Abbott added that the health department has made room at the Texas Center for Infectious Disease in San Antonio to reduce pressure on local hospitals. The facility, which features 22 negative pressure rooms sealed off the from the rest of the facility, is being used to care for patients being tested for COVID-19 and those who are positive with mild symptoms or are recovering.  There are 10 patients with the coronavirus in Texas, including six confirmed by the CDC and four who tested positively in Japan but whose results have not yet been confirmed by the U.S. agency. Of the 10, two came from Wuhan on a State Department-chartered flight and eight came from the Diamond Princess cruise.  There are 15 cases in the U.S. — none in Texas — that weren’t imported.  But CDC officials warned this week that it’s a matter of “when, not if” the virus arrives in the U.S. in larger numbers. The officials said people should start preparing for significant disruptions to daily life.  Noting the alarm that caused in some people who rushed out to buy water or face masks, Dr. Umair Shah, executive director of the Harris County Public Health Authority, said the remarks glossed over the timeline at which the U.S. cases are likely to significantly ramp up. He said that likely won’t be soon.  “The containment strategy in China was effective for giving everyone more time to prepare for the virus,” said Shah, noting the realistic hope was always to delay the virus’ spread, not stop it. “Governments were able to get information out and alert people to be on guard, just as they should be for the everyday flu.”  Shah said all Texas hospitals seem well prepared for the immediate stage, during which suspected COVID-19 cases are sporadic and staff are instructed to isolate patients whose travel history and symptoms suggest they may have contracted the virus. But he said not all Harris County and Texas hospitals are as well prepared for longer-term preparedness, when cases may be plentiful.  “We’re asking hospitals to really lean forward in surge planning,” said Shah. “This is the time for hospitals to really start planning what to do if they get an influx of coronavirus patients. The reality might be sooner rather than later.”  Carrie Williams, spokesperson for the Texas Hospital Association, said Thursday that hospitals are “well aware they are on the front lines and need to be ready for a possible COVID-19 patient to walk through the door at any moment.” She said the THA Wednesday convened Texas hospitals around the state on a call with the health department about the state of the disease, infection control protocols, preparedness measures, personal protective equipment and other issues.  It’s not just health care settings that are responding to the threat. Officials at six of Houston’s more populous school districts — Houston, Alief, Aldine, Katy, Cypress-Fairbanks and Klein — said this week they are monitoring updates on the spread of the coronavirus and following CDC protocols.  “We’re telling everybody to keep doing the same thing they’ve been doing to protect themselves from the flu, but I know in our district, we’re going to have a back up plan,” said Sheleah Reed, a spokeswoman for Aldine ISD in north Houston. “We’ll hammer out a plan just like we do with any other emergency or weather issue we meet about.”  Reed said hundreds of school district communications officials at an annual public relations meeting in Austin this week ended the day brainstorming about how to track and prepare for the potential of confirmed cases in their areas.  At Houston ISD, interim Superintendent Grentia Lathan wrote a letter to parents, detailing the district’s plans, which include training staff to regularly monitor educators and students who show symptoms, such as fevers, coughing, shortness of breath. Those who report feeling ill will go through assessment and monitoring, she wrote.  Texas universities previously clamped down on student and faculty travel to China, but a number of them — Texas A&M, the University of Texas-Austin, Baylor College of Medicine and Baylor University — this week extended their restrictions on college-funded travel to include South Korea. The country reported more than 250 cases last Friday, bringing its total to 2,022, the largest outbreak outside of China.

In a 6 p.m. update, the FDOH reported 1,007 confirmed cases in Florida residents and 70 confirmed cases in non-Florida residents, totaling 937 Florida-related cases.  The department was also reporting an additional death Sunday related to COVID-19 in Palm Beach County. This marks the first fatality in Palm Beach County from the virus. Health officials said there have been 13 deaths in Florida coronavirus cases.  About half of the state’s coronavirus cases have been reported in South Florida in Broward, Miami-Dade and Palm Beach counties, according to the FDOH.  The numbers also show that more than 60% of patients with COVID-19 in Florida are less than 69 years old, including two cases in children less than 9 years old, according to the Health Department.  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, older individuals and those with pre-existing health conditions are most at risk for becoming critically ill from the respiratory disease.  However, a recent from the CDC shows the rate of U.S. coronavirus cases requiring hospitalization was more widespread, regardless of age.  The Florida Department of Health updates confirmed cases daily at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m., however, the numbers may be lower than the actual count.  The number of confirmed cases is expected to grow this week as more testing sites open throughout the state.  More than 11,000 people have been tested for the highly contagious respiratory illness. COVID-19 is spread from person-to-person.  The University of Florida is offering coronavirus tests for residents at The Villages and a U.S. National Guard testing site at the Orange County Convention Center parking lot is set to open this week.

       "'At least three more Florida residents or visitors have died due to complications from the coronavirus, according to the latest Florida Department of Health numbers, as the number of confirmed infections in the state surged above 1,200.  As of Monday, only about 20 of Florida’s 67 counties were untouched by COVID-19 infections, however, as the number of large-scale testing sites continue to open across the state that is expected to change this week.  By Monday at 6 p.m. there were 1,227 confirmed cases of the coronavirus in Florida: 1,147 Florida residents and 80 non-Florida residents who tested positive in the state.  Florida health officials confirmed another death Monday morning bringing the state’s death toll to 14 but less than 8 hours later the state had confirmed four more deaths. Around 11 p.m., the Florida Department of Health posted a new update saying at least 17 people have died in the state from the coronavirus.  The 14th victim was in Palm Beach County, marking the second person to die due to the virus in the county in two days. The state has not yet released the whereabouts of the other victims.  [CORONAVIRUS BRIEFING: Daily ClickOrlando.com newsletter delivered to your inbox]  More than 2,000 people were tested over the weekend at a National Guard operated site at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami. On Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis is in The Villages where another drive-thru COVID-19 testing site will open, operated by University of Florida Shands hospital. Later in the week, the Florida National Guard will open another large-scale operation at the Orange County Convention Center parking lot. A large-scale site is also open in Jacksonville at the Jaguars’ TIAA Bank stadium.  “When this all started in Florida, every sample taken had to be sent to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and that was a very cumbersome process,” DeSantis said Monday at the opening of The Villages site. “A lot of times you didn’t get results for a week. Then we were able to have our three state laboratories certified, since then it’s been liberalized and we can take advantage of resources at places like the University of Florida.”  [INTERACTIVE MAP: Here’s where to get your drive-thru coronavirus test]  If you are having trouble viewing the map above on mobile, click here.  Nearly 14,000 people in Florida have been tested for COVID-19 as of Monday evening, according to the Department of Health.  DeSantis has issued several executive orders to prevent large social gatherings-- closing bars and nightclubs, along with restaurant dining rooms and gyms-- and mitigate possible exposures. He said Monday he thinks this is helping prevent the illness from spreading.  “We have 20 counties with zero infections,\" DeSantis said, adding 23 counties in Florida have only a few confirmed cases. \"That can obviously change, but in those counties we really want those people to get tested and be isolated so we can hopefully prevent an outbreak in some of those areas.”  Florida could also see a rise in COVID-19 cases, according to the governor, because of people flying into the state.  DeSantis said that when New York went into shelter-in-place provisions due to the virus people left and headed to Florida.  “Today there are over 190 direct flights from the New York City area to Florida,” DeSantis said. “I would reckon given the outbreak there that every single flight has someone on it that is positive for COVID-19, and so as we’re working to stop it in the state of Florida.”  The DOH updates its testing and case numbers twice daily at 11 a.m. and 6 p.m.  Here’s the breakdown of confirmed cases in Central Florida:  Brevard County: 7  Flagler County: 3  Lake County: 9  Marion County: 4  Orange County: 48  Osceola County: 25  Polk County: 13  Seminole County: 22  Sumter County: 8  Volusia County: 16  COVID-19 is a respiratory illness that is highly contagious and spread person-to-person. To help prevent new infections and slow the spread, the U.S. Centers for Disease control recommends people maintain 6 feet apart and do not gather in groups of 10 or more.  According to the World Health Organization, more than 15,000 people have died worldwide from the disease cased by COVID-19.

       "'Stories about the coronavirus pandemic are free to read as a public service at tampabay.com/coronavirus. If this coverage is important to you, consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to the Tampa Bay Times at tampabay.com/subscribe.  • • •  The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in Florida is doubling every three days, putting the state on a trajectory to see tens of thousands of infections in the coming weeks, a Tampa Bay Times analysis shows.  No rigorous model has been calculated for Florida to predict the disease’s spread in detail. Those usually take months to create.  But at this point, experts say the math is simple. The number of cases is already past the point of easy containment and infections are growing faster and faster, at what statisticians call an exponential rate.  Without dramatic steps, they worry that the epidemic will balloon across Florida and place an unprecedented strain on hospitals and health clinics.  Thomas Hladish, a University of Florida research scientist who specializes in disease modeling and has been advising the state on the outbreak, said that while epidemiologists might disagree on the nuances of their projections, they all agree on the main point.  “We do understand the math and the models well enough to say with great confidence that Florida is going to have a huge public health crisis,” Hladish said. “And we are just at the beginning of it right now.”  By 11 a.m. Saturday, Florida had reported more than 3,700 cases — an increase of nearly 1,000 in 24 hours.  Florida remains one of the few states with a large outbreak not to issue a statewide order to keep residents at home. Several counties across the state, including Hillsborough and Pinellas, issued “safer at home” orders in the last week.  Some public health experts say it will take the more extreme step of shutting down the state to halt the disease’s rapid spread in Florida. Nine hundred Florida healthcare workers had signed a petition by Friday asking for the same thing.  The effects of the intervention wouldn’t be apparent right away. The same is true for the smaller steps that have already been taken in Florida, like social distancing or closing restaurants and fitness studios.  “We are not going to see the benefits for a few weeks, which is frustrating to everyone,” said Dr. Mary Jo Trepka, an infectious disease epidemiologist and professor at Florida International University.  That’s because the statistics take time to catch up with the actual magnitude of the epidemic.  The reason for the lag is twofold.  People who get sick from the virus don’t typically show immediate symptoms of the illness it causes, COVID-19. Research by Johns Hopkins shows 50 percent of patients take five days or longer to develop symptoms. And people often wait another few days to get tested.  The testing process can add extra delays.  Cases show up in the data only after a positive test. Some labs are providing results within 48 hours. But others take a week or more. A Hillsborough County administrator said that results there were taking eight days or longer to process. And the BayCare Health System, one of the leading providers of tests in the Tampa Bay area, has said its results aren’t coming back for about a week.  Deaths, which climbed past 50 Saturday morning, take longer to appear in the data. The people who died recently were likely exposed to the virus in early March.  “What we are seeing today is where the epidemic was three weeks ago,” said José Szapocznik, a professor of public health sciences at the University of Miami’s Miller School of Medicine.  None of the information is captured if people with the disease aren’t tested.  Even though providers across Florida ramped up testing last week, the state has performed only about 40,000 tests. New York leads the country with more than 146,000, according to the COVID Tracking Project.  In Florida, as in the nation, the number of cases has grown almost perfectly in line with the number of tests, the Times analysis shows.  Experts say the low volume of testing nationwide — and the fact that different states have different criteria for who they will test — has made it difficult to get a handle of the size of the epidemic and make state-to-state comparisons.  Without more robust data in Florida, it’s impossible to know how many cases are actually out there.  But knowing the reported numbers are an undercount doesn’t change the alarming shape of the state’s curve.  On some recent days, reports of new cases in Florida have been accelerating as quickly as they were in New York. New York has become the epicenter of the outbreak in the United States. By Saturday afternoon, the state had logged more than 52,318 confirmed cases and 728 deaths.  While the epidemic has progressed differently in the two states and New York has more population density, experts say there’s no reason to expect the number of cases in Florida won’t continue spiking in a similar fashion.  “Quite honestly, if we don’t do anything, we’ll be like New York,” said Szapocznik, who believes a statewide stay-at-home order is necessary.  Reaching New York levels would mean not only a wave of sickness, but a crush of patients in the state’s intensive care units. Some New York hospitals are already approaching capacity.  “Think about it: The hospitals stop functioning because they are overwhelmed. They can’t be able to take care of regular patients,” said Robyn Gershon, a clinical professor of epidemiology at New York University’s School of Global Public Health. “That’s what we’re trying to prevent.”  • • •  Tampa Bay Times coronavirus coverage  GET THE DAYSTARTER MORNING UPDATE: Sign up to receive the most up-to-date information on COVID-19 and Tampa Bay, six days a week  ISOLATED ENTERTAINMENT: Lists of ideas to help entertain yourself and your kids at home  NEED TAKEOUT?: Here’s the Tampa Bay restaurants offering curbside pick-up or delivery  FOLLOW OUR COVERAGE ON SOCIAL MEDIA: Facebook.

       "'WLRN depends on donors to remain South Florida’s leading nonprofit, most trusted source of news and information. Support our mission by giving monthly as a sustaining member of Friends of WLRN or make a one-time donation of your choice. Thank you. Click here to give.  One of the most important things for the public during the COVID-19 public health emergency is access to reliable information from the state government.  Data can help the public weigh its need to respond to what is going on during a pandemic. When mapped out it can clearly show where cases are popping up, while demographic information can signal which populations might be most at risk from the spread of the novel coronavirus.  But what if the government is sharing incomplete, flawed, or otherwise questionable data?  A concerned citizen contacted WLRN this week to share information they have been gathering that raises potential red flags about data the Florida Department of Health and other statewide agencies have been sharing about the crisis. The person wanted to remain anonymous because they are not authorized to talk about the subject, but they did send us links, screenshots and pointed us to spreadsheets that, taken together, raise questions about the state data.  Through the tip and further reporting, we have identified a series of instances where information about reported COVID-19 cases altogether disappeared, was removed and then re-added, or might have been altered in some kind of fundamental way, to the point where it is unclear what’s actually being shown to the public.  “The state data has not been transparent, at the very least. You see some cases that are there in the dataset one day and gone the next day, with no explanation for why that’s happening,” said the tipster.  The data itself has been released in a dizzying variety of formats. At one point it was simple graphic tables, then Excel spreadsheets, then PDF documents. The columns of what information is being shown is inconsistent, making it exceedingly difficult to track particular cases, and track nuggets of information that are released through the different formats.  For instance, Thursday’s data contained a column for people who have died. Friday’s version puts that in a separate table entirely. The case numbers for both days don’t match up with one another. One day the case numbers are sorted in chronological order, the next by county.  “What that does is just create another layer of complication when you’re trying to track this on a statewide, or even a local basis,” said the caller.  COVID numbers behaving strangely  In the early days of the pandemic in Florida, when the numbers were somewhat low, each daily announcement from the Florida Department of Health included a table that listed the location and travel information for each case, along with demographic information about who had contracted COVID-19.  By comparing some of this early data with data released later on, some strange things happen.    Warning: the following gets a little bit complicated.    On March 12, the Florida Department of Health listed several new cases on its daily press release. Included in it were two cases in Sarasota County -- a 50-year-old man and a 70-year-old man; both were out of state residents and it was “unclear” whether they were travel related.  A 24-year-old woman was added in Alachua County. She had traveled to Europe, according to the release. Local media in Alachua County reported conflicting accounts of the person\\'s sex.  The following day, on March 13, the 24-year-old woman from Alachua County no longer appears on the table. But suddenly a 20-year-old male in Alachua County appears, without explanation.  The day after that, on March 14, the 50 and 70 year-old men from Sarasota County are no longer on the chart. Yet a 50-year-old female in Sarasota County suddenly appears. In Alachua County, the 20-year-old male who was just added the previous day is no longer there. Instead, a 24-year-old male from Alachua County is listed.  To recap: The original Alachua County case — announced on March 13 — was a 24-year-old female. Then this person disappeared from the chart, followed by a 20-year-old male who disappeared from the data after one day. Then, a 24-year-old male appears, with no reference to whatever happened to the 24-year-old female who was reportedly the first case in the county.  This past Monday, on March 16, the state migrated from these tables to a statewide map, showing the case load by county. By inspecting the data on the back end of the website, it was possible to access the spreadsheet the map was using to populate the map.  A spreadsheet downloaded that day showed three Broward County cases that were on the table the previous day were now missing: a 41-year-old male whose case was unclear if he traveled; a 49-year-old female whose case was travel-related; and a 48-year-old female whose case was travel-related.  In the most recently released data, information matching the 48 or 49-year-olds in Broward County is still nowhere to be found; A 49-year-old female from Broward who did not travel is listed, as well as a 48-year-old male — not a female.  It is unclear if these are the same people with updated data points, or if these are entirely different cases.  On Monday, the data showed a 22-year-old female who lived in Broward County who had recently traveled to Ireland. By Wednesday, that data was not reflected in data powering the statewide mapping tool. And finally on Friday, her information appeared once again.  The 50 and 70-year-old males from Sarasota County who disappeared on March 14 have now reappeared in the data. The 20-year-old from Alachua County who was listed on March 13 has disappeared from the dataset altogether.  If all of this sounds incredibly confusing, that’s because it is.  These are just a small number of inconsistencies that we found analyzing day-to-day data released by the state. There could well be more, but analyzing the data is complicated by the constantly changing formats through which the data is released.  \\'Consistency is key\\'  “Consistency is key when you’re reporting this kind of public health data,” said Nora Friedman, a senior data analyst at the Chicago Center for HIV Elimination, under the University of Chicago hospital system. “For new things that you’re tracking it’s normal to kind of track and release data on the fly, but a few weeks into this, it surprises me that there’s not one template they’re going by.”  Friedman said she would guess that the problems with the data can be chalked up to confusion rather than deliberate misdirection. The state might actually need some help analyzing and reporting the data to the public, she suggested.  \"We\\'re just trying to evolve and get the information out as quickly as possible, and that means we\\'re fine- tuning the way that we present the data to the public,\" a representative for the Joint Information Center on COVID-19 for the State of Florida told WLRN.  The representative said that the inconsistencies can be chalked up to the fact that the daily reports say that the data is \"provisional and subject to change.\" Notably, the statewide map that visualizes the data present in the daily reports does not contain that provision.  \"When we get a reported case, there is an epidemiological investigation that takes place. We try our best to figure out where the person might have contracted it, and move down the list contacting everyone we think that person might have been in contact with since contracting it,\" said the representative. \"Sometimes that information can lead to changes after the fact of what you see when you\\'re looking at the data from one day to the next.\"  For example, sometimes a person tests positive in one county, and later authorities learn that the person is a resident of another county. That could initiate a change in where that particular case is listed, leading to be removed from one county and perhaps added to another county, without any public announcement about why that has occurred.  Friedman and the person who initially contacted WLRN said that this leaves open questions about data transparency that the public and local government agencies are relying on.  “The one thing I’ll say is that it would be good to have some kind of corrections table for when someone is removed, to say ‘X person was removed for X reason,’” said Friedman. “That would help the public have more faith in the data, and that what they’re looking at is the most accurate and up-to-date information available.”'"

Some have no symptoms at all. By far the largest group present with fever and other symptoms. Most will get better on their own. About 15% of those infected go on to have severe illness and must be hospitalized. Another 5% become so ill that they must be treated in an intensive care unit.  Get the full story.  What are the symptoms of coronavirus?  Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and some people don\\'t have any symptoms at all. The most common symptoms resemble the flu and include fever, tiredness and dry cough. Some people also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.  Patients with COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough and shortness of breath, the Centers for Disease Control said.  About 1 in 6 people becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organization. If you experience fever, cough and shortness of breath, call your doctor.  Symptoms may appear anywhere between two to 14 days after exposure, with the average patient seeing onset at around five days, according to the CDC.'"

In the Florida Keys, swamped with young spring breakers and travelers from around the world, just 16 people had been tested by Monday night. Ten of Florida’s 67 counties have tested no one at all.  A disease that is deadly to the elderly and easily spread by the young has left Florida especially vulnerable. Yet faced with the prospect of dealing a shattering blow to an $86 billion tourism industry, Gov. Ron DeSantis has moved more slowly than some other states to contain a pandemic that is spreading with alarming speed. Whole swaths of the state have yet to begin robust testing, according to State Department of Health data. And even as some of the beaches still swarmed with college revelers, the state refused to close them.  In many cases, even people who have a known exposure or are exhibiting symptoms have not been offered testing, according to interviews with doctors, patients and family members across the state.'"

Hundreds more continue to test positive for the COVID-19 coronavirus, latest advisories from the state Department of Health confirm.  Approximately 6,741 in Florida have tested positive for COVID-19, according to an evening advisory Tuesday from the state agency. Tuesday also marked the first day the state reported more than 1,000 new cases of COVID-19 since the state agency began tracking coronavirus.  Fatalities linked to the coronavirus also continue to soar, with the state Department of Health reporting 85 in Florida to have fallen victim to the virus.  A 28-year-old male in Sarasota County with travel history in Illinois and Florida has died of coronavirus complications, the state agency reported. His death is the youngest of the state\\'s 85 fatalities tied to the virus.  Ages of the deceased range from 28 to 96, according to the latest advisories.  Among the state\\'s rising number of cases, 857 are reported as being hospitalized. Also among the data are 56,644 who have tested negative for coronavirus.  Florida is expected to ramp up statewide testing, with Gov. Ron DeSantis announcing the approval of an FDA-approved test with results in 45 minutes at a press conference Monday morning. Those tests are expected to be available in the hardest hit areas of the state, including Miami-Dade and Broward counties.

Public health expert calls for statewide lockdown  5:01 p.m.  After publishing an analysis that predicts Florida could see thousands of COVID-19 deaths and a shortage of hospital intensive care unit beds, a public health expert with the University of Washington’s Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation is calling on Gov. Ron DeSantis to issue a statewide lockdown.  Ali Mokdad, a professor of health metric sciences, told the Miami Herald that he advised Florida Surgeon General Scott Rivkees to implement a lockdown. DeSantis has resisted such a move.  Mokdad was part of a team that developed a model forecasting COVID-19 deaths nationwide, and in each state. The model also looks at the potential strain on the health care system.  Read the complete story here.

That ended abruptly two weeks ago, said Moore, owner of Moore Hospitality Search in Jensen Beach.  \"I had five interviews set up for last Tuesday, and all but one of them canceled. Now I\\'m getting lots of good, quality applicants, but nowhere for them to go,\" he said.  The coronavirus prompted the governor to close all restaurant dining rooms in Florida March 20, after initially trying to limit crowd sizes to enforce \"social distancing.\"  \"How bad the virus affected a restaurant depended on your business model,\" Moore said. \"Full-service restaurants are either closed, unless they have established curbside or delivery business. Fast food restaurants haven\\'t been as affected.\"  Read full story here.  DeSantis urged to enact statewide evictions ban  1:36 p.m. March 31  Gov. Ron DeSantis should impose a statewide moratorium on evictions to avoid the ouster of thousands of tenants who have lost jobs because of the coronavirus shutdowns, Democratic lawmakers and local officials said Tuesday.  With first-of-the-month payments putting added pressure on financially strapped Floridians, those urging action said worries about being evicted is a burden state government could ease.  DeSantis has said little about pocketbook concerns for Floridians, instead focusing on the state’s need for stepping up testing, and self-isolation. He has refused calls for statewide shelter-in-place directives, although he issued such an order Monday for four South Florida counties through mid-April.  Get the full story.  FHSAA looks to extend spring sports season to June 30, add eligibility to seniors  1:42 p.m. March 31  The Florida High School Athletic Association is looking to extend the spring sports season to June 30 and adding eligibility to spring senior athletes, the state high school association announced Tuesday afternoon.  Gov. Ron DeSantis and the state Department of Education mandated Monday for Florida schools to remain closed until Monday, May 4.

One way to look at Florida’s outbreak is to use a statistical method called a logarithmic scale. On a chart that uses a logarithmic scale, we can more easily track how quickly a measure is doubling.  While the growth rate has slowed slightly, over the last month, the number of confirmed cases doubled every three days on average.  In just the last week, it doubled every four days.

Big Bend counties get subpar grades for coronavirus social distancing, cell phone data shows  March 31  Leon County and several of its Big Bend neighbors scored Ds and worse — for a time at least — on how well they\\'re social distancing during the coronavirus outbreak.  But their low grades Monday morning improved by afternoon based on more recent data that tech firm Unacast is crunching as part of its nationwide Social Distancing Scoreboard.  The scoreboard uses cell phone data to measure how far people are traveling on average now compared to pre-pandemic days. Counties with the biggest drop in travel score the highest grades.

Ron DeSantis and the state\\'s top administrators have focused on testing, getting supplies and making sure hospitals will have enough beds to meet the coming surge.  A new mass drive-through testing site opens Tuesday in Palm Beach County, following the opening of a site in Miami-Dade County. They join sites in Orlando, Jacksonville, Tallahassee and Broward County.  The state has gotten 2,000 test kits that can process a sample in 45 minutes, but the results still must go to the state Department of Health or U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation.

Blame the combination of humidity, blustery island breezes, too many dollars already in place, and the relative adhesive properties of various styles of tape.  \"We have about $20,000 that falls off the walls every year,\" Cabbage Key\\'s owner Rob Wells said.  \"We have been, for as long as I can remember, donating those fallen dollars to various charities.\"  The inn started a special \"fallen dollars\" collection last week to help Pine Island and Southwest Florida residents impacted by COVID-19.

Florida officials debate letting cruise ships dock with ill passengers  7:34 a.m. March 31  Holland America\\'s MS Zaandam and MS Rotterdam cruise ships – one with ill people on board – have crossed the Panama Canal and are headed to Florida. But several government officials, including Gov. Ron DeSantis, are concerned about the ships\\' plans to head to Fort Lauderdale.  Four elderly passengers on the Zaandam died, though the causes of death have not been disclosed; 73 guests and 116 crew members reported flu-like symptoms. Symptoms of the flu and coronavirus are similar.  The Zaandam’s plans to dock as early as Wednesday in Florida are still up in the air but have already been rebuked by local officials and DeSantis, who says health care resources are stretched too thin. The governor said he has been in contact with the Coast Guard and the White House about diverting the ship.  Get the full story.  Florida megachurch pastor arrested for holding services, defying social distancing orders  6:29 a.m. March 31  Florida officials have arrested the pastor of a megachurch after detectives say he held two Sunday services with hundreds of people and violated a safer-at-home order in place to limit the spread of the coronavirus.  According to jail records, Pastor Rodney Howard-Browne turned himself in to authorities Monday afternoon in Hernando County, where he lives. He was charged with unlawful assembly and violation of a public health emergency order.  Howard-Browne isn’t alone in refusing to curtail in-person worship services despite public health orders designed to stop the virus from spreading. Churches in Ohio, Kentucky and Louisiana have continued to invite worshippers in recent days as at least a half-dozen states offer some degree of exemption for faith in their orders to shutter nonessential activity during the pandemic.

DeSantis orders \\'safer at home\\' rule for all of South Florida  March 30  The morning after President Trump issued a 30-day extension of a federal voluntary shutdown to contain the spread of the coronavirus, Gov. Ron DeSantis Monday announced a four-county \"safer at home\" executive order for all of southeast Florida.  \"With this order we are going guns blazing to do all we can to slow the spread of COVID-19,\" Desantis said at a news conference in the parking lot of Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens.  Meanwhile, he continued to defend his decision to not order a blanket statewide shutdown and allow local governments to make their own decisions about closing beaches and nonessential businesses and requesting people to stay home as much as possible.

March 29  There\\'s so much to touch and grab at the grocery store — shopping carts, freezer door handles, cardboard boxes and plastic packaging.  Such surfaces are almost unavoidable for shoppers. But they also carry a certain amount of risk in the age of the COVID-19 pandemic, adding urgency to a troubling question: Have pharmacies and supermarkets become super-spreading virus vectors?  Get the full story.  What are the symptoms of coronavirus?  Symptoms can range from mild to severe, and some people don\\'t have any symptoms at all. The most common symptoms resemble the flu and include fever, tiredness and dry cough. Some people also develop aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea.  Patients with COVID-19 have had mild to severe respiratory illness with symptoms of fever, cough, and shortness of breath, the Centers for Disease Control said.  About 1 in 6 people becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing, according to the World Health Organization. If you experience fever, cough and shortness of breath, call your doctor.  Symptoms may appear anywhere between two to 14 days after exposure, with the average patient seeing onset at around five days, according to the CDC.'"

       "'The president’s aides — some of whom have tired of Mr. DeSantis’s special requests and believe he takes advantage of the relationship with the White House — tried to explain to the president that it would be almost impossible to enforce such a quarantine. Mr. Trump has also resisted a broader national stay-at-home order, which his advisers see as at odds with years of Republican orthodoxy about states’ rights, and unfair to states that are not experiencing major outbreaks.  On Sunday, the White House dropped its earlier, rosier suggestion that stringent social-distancing measures could be lifted by mid-April, and extended national guidelines to combat the coronavirus until April 30. And on Tuesday, Mr. Trump sounded a distinctly somber note, as he acknowledged for the first time that the next two weeks will be “painful” and allowed that predictions of more than 100,000 deaths were realistic possibilities.  Still, when Mr. DeSantis on Monday signed a more limited stay-at-home order for four counties from Key West to Palm Beach, he insisted that it would be needed only through April 15. Because most of the affected cities and counties, like other large jurisdictions in the state, had already enacted their own orders, the governor conceded his own action was of little consequence.  Cellphone location data showed that people in places like Jacksonville and Daytona Beach in northeast Florida, which were not on lockdown, were frequently traveling across county lines. Commissioners in southwest Florida’s Lee County, which likewise had no stay-at-home order, maintained that they did not need one, in part because the governor had not suggested it.  “It seems like he’s listening to the Florida Chamber and Associated Industries and business interests more than he is to medical professionals and health care professionals, which is incredibly disappointing,” Mayor Rick Kriseman of St. Petersburg said before the governor’s latest order. He added that neither the governor nor his staff had called at any point to ask about the city’s needs.  “I may not have agreed on a whole lot of things with Rick Scott when he was governor,” said Mr. Kriseman, a Democrat. “But every time there was a storm approaching the state, I got a phone call from him saying, ‘Just wanted to check in, see how you’re doing, is there anything you need?’” (Mr. Scott, now the state’s junior Republican senator, called him on Saturday.)'"

Positive cases of the novel COVID-19 coronavirus eclipsed 3,000 cases, as expected, Friday, according to an evening advisory from the state Department of Health.  Confirmed cases continue to jump by the hundreds as the state has issued more testing in counties like Broward and Miami-Dade, where together 1,500 having tested positive.

House approves historic coronavirus package, sending $2 trillion bill to Trump’s desk  1:49 p.m. March 27  The House voted to pass a $2 trillion coronavirus relief package – the largest emergency aid bill in history – that will offer $1,200 checks to Americans, extensive unemployment benefits for those out of work and financial relief to businesses and the health care industry hard-hit by the worsening crisis.  The House’s vote allows the bill to head to President Donald Trump’s desk for final approval. Trump has signaled he will sign the bill.  Get the full story.  While other states temporarily ban abortion, Florida gives doctors discretion  12:48 p.m. March 27  As states temporarily ban doctors from performing elective procedures in a bid to preserve personal-protective equipment during the coronavirus outbreak, Ohio and Texas have used the orders to restrict abortions. Florida is not following suit.  Gov. Ron DeSantis, like the governors in Texas, Ohio and elsewhere, has banned “medically unnecessary, non-urgent or non-emergency procedures.” But DeSantis, unlike state officials in Texas and Ohio, is letting doctors determine for themselves what procedures fall under his order.  That means abortions, for the most part, should continue even as the state deals with ever-increasing confirmations of COVID-19.  Get the fully story.  Coronavirus?

The economic downturn brought on by the virus is expected to be even more pronounced in a state that is heavily dependent on tourism and other service sector industries that have been paralyzed.  That means many Floridians will face a difficult stretch in the coming months. There are a number of provisions in the relief bill that could disproportionately benefit the Sunshine State, from the direct payments to individuals and families to the increase in unemployment benefits and the loans for small businesses.

On Thursday, U.S. Reps. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Sunrise, and Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, said on a conference call that they expected to cast their vote remotely in favor of the legislation that passed the U.S. Senate 96-0.  The only hiccup they said would be if a member objected, which would then require a vote in person. That objection materialized late Thursday when Kentucky Republican U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky voiced his reservations about a voice vote.

Could it be the next epicenter?  6:47 a.m. March 27  The Sunshine State has come under fire after its beaches remained jammed with spring breakers last week and Gov. Ron DeSantis has ignored calls to issue a statewide shelter-in-place order.  That may contribute to Florida becoming the next hot spot for COVID-19, a chilling possibility considering that the elderly are the most likely to die from the disease and Florida is home to nearly four million people 65 and over, the second-highest number in the U.S. behind California.

Containment strategies still debated as numbers near 2,500  6:35 p.m. March 26  As the number of cases and deaths related to COVID-19 — the illness caused by the novel coronavirus — rise dramatically in Florida, the debate over how best to contain the virus and keep it from spreading goes on.

UF Health workers devise way to reuse hospital materials, otherwise discarded  4:56 p.m. March 26  With respiratory masks used by health workers battling the coronavirus in short supply, the University of Florida Health’s department of anesthesiology has developed masks that can be produced in large quantities using materials already found in hospitals and medical facilities.  N95 respirator masks have been in high demand worldwide since the outbreak of COVID-19. That led a UF Health anesthesiology professor to create a simple respirator mask from the sterile wrapping that is normally used to surround surgical instrument trays before they pass through gas sterilization or an autoclave.  The innovative mask uses Halyard H600 two-ply spun polypropylene that cannot be penetrated by water, bacteria or particles. It blocks 99.9% of particulates, making the masks about 4% more effective at blocking particulate material than the N95 masks, according to Bruce Spiess, M.D., a professor of anesthesiology in the UF College of Medicine, who made that calculation based on the manufacturer’s specifications.

Rick Scott is now among a group of Republican senators critical of the $2 trillion coronavirus bailout package making its way through Congress.  Scott, who ultimately supported the massive proposal expected to win House approval Friday, said the $600 weekly payouts to those losing their jobs would “disincentive people from returning to the workforce.”  Get the full story.

Brightline train service suspended, 250 lose jobs  7:45 p.m. March 25  Brightline train service between Miami and West Palm Beach was suspended until further notice late Wednesday and more than 250 employees have been laid off in response to the coronavirus pandemic, a company spokesman said Wednesday.  The high-speed rail service announced it would stop running trains in an effort to limit the public’s exposure to coronavirus, which has infected 141 people in Palm Beach County and nearly 2,000 in Florida, according to state health officials.

Orange was among the most recent to enact stay-at-home orders and other local governments have put similar orders on their agendas. Leon County also issued an order, but it left business operations in the capital city almost entirely untouched.

What you Should Know  COVID-19 can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, including when an individual coughs or sneezes. These droplets may land on objects and surfaces. Other people may contract COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth.  Symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, cough and shortness of breath. Symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as many as 14 days following exposure. Most people recover from COVID-19 without needing special treatment. The elderly and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems and diabetes are more likely to develop serious illness.  There is currently no vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The best way to prevent illness is to avoid being exposed to the virus. The Department recommends everyday preventive actions to help stop the spread of respiratory diseases, including:  Avoiding close contact with people who are sick;  Staying home when you are sick and avoiding contact with persons in poor health;  Avoiding touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands;  Covering your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then disposing of the tissue;  Washing your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom, before eating, after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing;  If soap and water are not readily available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Always wash hands with soap and water if hands are visibly dirty; and  Cleaning and disinfecting frequently touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe.  The CDC does not recommend that asymptomatic, healthy people wear a facemask to protect themselves from respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Facemasks should be used by people who show symptoms of COVID-19 to help prevent the spread of the disease to others. The use of facemasks is also crucial for health workers and people who are taking care of someone in close settings (at home or in a health care facility).  A person that experiences a fever and symptoms of respiratory illness, such as fever, cough or shortness of breath, within 14 days after travel from China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, Japan and any other destination under CDC travel advisory should call ahead to their health care provider and local CHD and mention their recent travel or close contact.  If a person has had close contact with someone showing these symptoms who has recently traveled from this area or been in contact with a person with laboratory-confirmed COVID-19, they should call ahead to a health care professional and the CHD. The health care provider will work with the Department to determine if the person should be tested for COVID-19.

       "'TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Two people who tested positive for the coronavirus have died in Florida, marking the first deaths on the East Coast attributed to the outbreak in the U.S., health officials said Friday.  The Florida Department of Health said the two people who died were in their 70s and had traveled overseas. The announcement raises the U.S. death toll from the novel coronavirus strain to 17, including 13 in the state of Washington and one in California.  One of the Florida deaths was that of a man with underlying health issues in Santa Rosa County in Florida’s Panhandle, according to the statement. The health department added that the second death was that of an elderly person in Lee County, in the Fort Myers area.  I have directed @FLSERT to activate to Level II to ensure Florida has all the necessary resources engaged as we respond to #COVID19. It is critical that we proactively coordinate all state resources to mitigate and contain #COVID19. — Ron DeSantis (@GovRonDeSantis) March 7, 2020  The statement did not give immediate indications of where the two had traveled or whether officials were seeking to determine who they came in contact with.  Helen Aguirre Ferre, a spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, confirmed the deaths and other new cases in South Florida.  The Florida Department of Health also announced two new positive tests in Broward County. They are both men, ages 65 and 75.  The state now has seven positive cases of coronavirus -- three in the Tampa Bay area. A presumptive positive case in Manatee County was reported Saturday night. The person has been isolated, officials say.  In Central Florida, the Florida Department of Health Saturday reported a \"presumptive positive\" case of the coronavirus in Volusia County with a 66-year-old woman. Florida DOH also reported presumptive case of coronavirus in Okaloosa County with a 61-year-old woman.  Both are being isolated, public health officials said. They also both reportedly have traveled outside the U.S. recently.  Health officials also instructed people who traveled on a Nile River cruise in Egypt in 2020 to isolate themselves for 14 days after returning to the U.S. after some passengers developed symptoms upon their return.  Meanwhile, DeSantis is requesting $25 million in emergency funding to fight the virus, helping pay for lab supplies, masks and additional staff for state and local health departments.

VIRUS CONTINUES TO FORCE CANCELLATIONS  This year’s HIMSS Global Health Conference, set for March 9-13 in Orlando - a massive event with President Trump planning to attend - will be cancelled for the first time in 58 years.  HIMSS CEO Hal Wolf said it would be an unacceptable risk to bring so many thousands together.  They’re not alone.  The McDonald’s Worldwide 2020 convention calling off its April event for worldwide franchises, too.  And, this year’s Grainger show cancelling, too, organizers saying “Even though the health risk in North America from the Coronavirus remains low, the situation is getting more complex each day.”  As for concerns about sick time amongst employees as the virus continues to spread statewide, Governor DeSantis stressing yesterday that it makes financial sense to encourage potentially sick employees to stay home.  \"Somebody that’s been in contact, traveled, developed some of the symptoms and they’re told to self-isolate, you’re going to lose less by having them go through that and then coming back healthy, than if they come to work sick and then infect other people in your workforce,\" DeSantis said. \"And I think most employers have understood that. So even as a health matter you want to do that but even as an economic matter, I think it makes more sense to do that.\"  Governor De Santis says testing capacity in Florida has been able to meet the demand here in the state, with just a few outstanding tests awaiting results.  AFL-CIO Presidential Forum Canceled  The AFL-CIO presidential forum that was set to be attended by Democratic presidential candidates Sen. Bernie Sanders and former-Vice President Joe Biden has been canceled, according to a spokesperson for Biden\\'s campaign.  Concerns over the COVID-19 outbreak were cited.  The forum was set to happen Thursday.  UPDATE: Getting word the Orlando AFL CIU conference @JoeBiden and @BernieSanders were supposed to attend Thursday is now canceled... coronavirus. Awaiting more detail. @MyNews13 @bn9 https://t.co/66SVy50gJ2 — Greg Angel (@NewsGuyGreg) March 8, 2020  Information from the Associated Press was used in this report.'"

To support important local journalism like this, please consider becoming a digital subscriber.  -------------  We\\'ll update this story throughout the day with the latest news about coronavirus and its effects in Florida.  A person in Orange County who tested positive for COVID-19 has died, the Florida Department of Health announced Monday evening.  There are now 160 confirmed cases of coronavirus in Florida, according to the latest advisory from the Florida Department of Health.  More:Brevard County reports its first coronavirus case  The numbers were made available at 7 p.m., hours after the Florida Department of Health announced plans to have updates available twice daily, effective Monday.  The latest advisory includes five new cases, and follows an advisory that included 19 new COVID-19 cases, split between 14 Florida residents and five non-Florida residents.  Miami-Dade saw one of the largest increase in the latest numbers, jumping from 13 to 23 cases.  Bars, wineries and restaurants were closed in Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington, and mayors in New York City and Los Angeles took the same action in those cities. Customers were encouraged to support those businesses by ordering through delivery or takeout. U.S. McDonald\\'s locations announced plans to close dining areas following close Monday, while still continuing drive-thru operations and in-person carry out ordering.  The CDC issued new recommendations late Sunday, saying that gatherings of 50 or more people should not take place in the U.S. for the next eight weeks. The recommendation does not apply to businesses or schools.  Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and members of President Donald Trump\\'s coronavirus task force, told Americans the outbreak will get worse before it gets better, and to get ready to \"hunker down.\" He doesn\\'t believe a 14-day nationwide shutdown would be overreacting; in fact, he thinks it\\'s likely necessary, adding that actions could be recommended into August or July. \"Could be longer than that,\" the president said.

Use this map to track the outbreak of COVID-19  More:Coronavirus cancellations: Masters, NASCAR the latest sports events suspended amid COVID-19  Here are the latest numbers available from the Florida Department of Health:  Coronavirus case count in Florida now will be updated twice daily  1:11 p.m.  As more people are tested in South Florida and other hot spots of the coronavirus outbreak, the Florida Department of Health is moving to twice-daily updates about new cases starting Monday.  Updates will be posted midday and around 6 p.m., according to Helen Aguirre Ferré, spokeswoman for Gov. Ron DeSantis.  The department has also designed a new dashboard for tracking cases that allows viewers to dive deep by clicking on to each county for more detail on each case. For example, clicking on Broward County — which still has by far the largest number of cases — will expand a box that gives the number of cases (38), the number that are travel-related (15), the number of men (21) and women (17), and the age range (19-83).

FHSAA declines to take position on new CDC crowd guidelines  11:53 a.m.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends canceling or postponing gatherings of more than 50 people for the next eight weeks to curb the spread of COVID-19, but it’s not immediately clear how that will impact high school sports in Florida.  The Florida High School Athletic Association had no comment Monday morning when asked if it had a response to the CDC’s recommendation.  “Right now, we’re sticking to what we said Thursday,” FHSAA public relations specialist Ashton Moseley said, referring to the organization’s latest news release on the coronavirus. “We’re leaving it up to the local school districts, and we are monitoring the situation.”  Get the full story here  Surgeon general: US could see high mortality rate if Americans don\\'t follow guidelines  10:32 a.m.  The United States will end up with as high a mortality rate from the coronavirus as Italy without an aggressive response that includes Americans following the federal government’s guidance, Surgeon General Jerome Adams said on “Fox & Friends” Monday.  “When you look at the projections, there\\'s every chance that we could be Italy,” Adams said.  “But there\\'s every hope that we will be South Korea if people actually listen, if people actually social distance, if people do the basic public health measures that we\\'ve all been talking about as doctors all along, such as washing your hands, such as covering your cough, and cleaning surfaces.”  Get the full story here.  Drive-through testing center opens in Palm Springs  10:14 a.m.:  A nonprofit health center in Palm Springs began providing drive-through testing for the coronavirus.  The staff at FoundCare, a nonprofit Federally Qualified Health Center, fielded hundreds of calls in the hours since announcing it would be doing drive-thru testing for the coronavirus.  The staff is screening potential patients via phone to prioritize those who will be tested first.  Get the full story here.

The order also waives the delinquent renewal fees during the extension period for the driver licenses and identification cards.  Disney World officially closes its doors; more Disney closures announced  9:12 a.m.  As Disney lovers waved goodbye to Walt Disney World, which closed Sunday night in response to the coronavirus pandemic, the company announced several park-adjacent hotels, dining and shopping experiences would also shut down.

Florida cases crack 100 as officials expect even more with testing expanding  5 a.m.  With 39 new cases reported early Sunday, the number of novel coronavirus cases in Florida is now over 100 as test kits are being distributed across the state, and officials said the number of people diagnosed positive will continue to increase sharply.  South Florida — with three international airports, busy cargo and passenger shipping ports, and a large concentration of elderly — continues to be the epicenter of that growth with more than half of all positive cases diagnosed so far.  Broward County alone has 36 cases, including a group of young people from NOVA Southeastern University who all traveled as a group to Ireland, and exposed their relatives to the virus.  On Sunday, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced that the state was partnering with the Florida National Guard and Memorial Healthcare to start mobile drive-through testing in Broward. Close to 175 guards were deployed Sunday with another several hundred on the way, he said, adding that they could probably partner with other hospitals in South Florida.  He also said he\\'s asked the Department of Health for as much \"amplifying information\" as possible regarding COVID-19 tests to see more details on clusters within counties.  Get the full story here  Coronavirus vaccine trial starts Monday  8:38 p.m. Sunday  A clinical trial evaluating a vaccine designed to protect against the new coronavirus will begin Monday, according to a government official.  The first participant in the trial will receive the experimental vaccine on Monday, the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because the trial has not been publicly announced yet.  Get the full story here.  5 states close bars and restaurants to combat coronavirus  6:42 p.m. Sunday  The governors in five states — California, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts and Washington — mandated the closings of bars, restaurants and wineries in an effort to slow the spread of coronavirus.  In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine said bars and restaurants can stay open for carry-out and delivery but \"what we can\\'t have is people congregating and seated.\"  \"I\\'m aware that this will impact many, many good workers,\" DeWine wrote on Twitter. \"I can\\'t tell you how sorry I am, but we will work to mitigate the suffering. It is our goal for everyone to get through this.  \"Every day we delay, more people will die.\"  Read the full story here.  Stores closing, cutting hours: Nike, Apple, Walmart, others  3:57 p.m. Sunday  Retailers across the nation are trimming store hours to focus on deep cleanings and to restock store shelves. Some are closing stores, too.  Apple announced it will close all its retail stores outside Greater China until March 27 due to the coronavirus outbreak. Urban Outfitters also announced all of its stores worldwide would be closed at least until March 28. Nike is making a similar move, temporarily closing all of its stores in the U.S. for 12 days, the company said in a statement.  Read the full story here.

       "'ORLANDO, Fla. – Two people have died from the Coronavirus in Florida, according to the Department of Health.  Health officials said a previously announced patient in Santa Rosa County has died.  During a news conference in Gadsden County Thursday, DeSantis said the Santa Rosa County man was in his 70s with underlying health issues who had recently traveled internationally.  FDOH also said a new patient in their 70s tested positive for Coronavirus in Lee County, this patient has died.  The patient recently went on an international trip, according to health officials.  The department of health also confirmed two other presumptive cases. One in Lee County and another in Charlotte County. According to officials, both individuals are being cared for.  .@HealthyFla has announced a new presumptive positive Florida #COVID19 case in Charlotte County: the individual is isolated and being appropriately cared for.

For the total case count and more important information, visit https://t.co/e1S8bGG26U @CDCgov — Florida Dept. Health (@HealthyFla) March 7, 2020  A 75-year-old man in Broward County and a 65-year-old man in Broward County have tested positive for the virus. Both men will remain in isolation until they are cleared by officials, according to the department of health.  Five other Floridians are recovering out of state.  The other three cases are in Hillsborough and Manatee counties.  A patient hospitalized for the virus was discharged from a Sarasota hospital Friday, Doctors Hospital of Sarasota officials said in a news release.  Hospital officials said they reduced entry points to the hospital to allow screening for all people entering the facility. While the patient was hospitalized operating rooms were close and affected employees were furloughed with full pay, according to a news release.  DeSantis also said five Florida residents who had been traveling in China have also been quarantined elsewhere after testing positive for the virus. He didn’t say where those five people live or where they are being quarantined.  According to the Florida Department of Health website, there are 51 patients awaiting test results in Florida. As of Friday, more than 260 individuals are being monitored for symptoms, either due to having close contact with someone who was diagnosed with the virus or because they’ve recently traveled to an affected area.  The virus poses a low risk of spread from one person to another through contact of a shared surface but is spread from person to person through coughing, sneezing or exhaling, according to the CDC and the World Health Organization.  [MORE: How to get your coronavirus questions answered | Florida nursing homes urged to take coronavirus precautions]  Symptoms of the virus include fever and signs or symptoms of lower respiratory illness, including cough or shortness of breath. Signs may appear between two to 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC.  The best way health officials say to protect against COVID-19 is to wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, after visiting public places, going to the bathroom, before eating and after blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing.  If soap and water are not available health officials say to use hand sanitizers with at least 60% alcohol.  DeSantis spoke in Orlando Wednesday afternoon, saying that the risk for coronavirus infections remains low, even with Florida’s large tourism industry.  No one has tested positive for coronavirus in Orange County, although fewer than 30 people are under observation due to travel to affected countries, according to county health officials.  Editor’s note: An earlier version of this report indicated the fourth coronavirus patient in Florida was in Gadsden County. The story has been corrected to clarify the governor made his announcement in Gadsden County but the patient is in Santa Rosa County.  The Associated Press contributed to this story.'"

If this coverage is important to you, consider supporting local journalism by subscribing to the Tampa Bay Times at tampabay.com/subscribe.  • • •  Routine left us suddenly.  It disappeared with a buzz in our pocket, and then another, and then another because in the 24 hours when coronavirus erased America’s plans, everything was BREAKING.  Travel from Europe went first, or at least some of it, President Donald Trump’s flat voice belying the unfolding drama from the White House. Then came the National Basketball Association season, suspended indefinitely, foretold by an empty court in Oklahoma City where the announcer was strangely subdued.  “Fans,” he said, “due to unforeseen circumstances, the game tonight has been postponed.”  Unforeseen circumstances turned out to be COVID-19, the flu-like disease at the center of a global pandemic, now spreading in the United States and forcing organizers to call off the big plans that bring people together. For the next few weeks at least, together is going to be too risky. Better to stay out of spitting distance from coughing and sneezing neighbors.  March Madness in Tampa was going to happen without fans, and now won’t at all. Multiple schools in the Tampa Bay area have closed. The National Hockey League will take a break. Spring Training was suspended, a Florida tradition packed up just as quickly as it came. Opening Day was pushed back at least two weeks. The jets will not roar at Tampa Bay AirFest, but the IndyCars will race at the Firestone Grand Prix in St. Petersburg — with no admirers to stand and holler as the rumble reaches their chests. Golfers at the Valspar Championship were going to play without onlookers, free of worry about shouting on their backswings, then the tournament was nixed altogether.  The next few weeks, in sum, are canceled. Whatever isn’t likely will go on without an audience. This is what doctors call social distancing, a cumbersome term for what is more like a ripping away of the tablecloth on which we set our lives.  “I am recommending to local municipalities and private entities to strongly consider limiting or postponing mass gatherings in the state of Florida,” Gov. Ron DeSantis said at a hospital in Miami.  He ran through the numbers, which change by the day. Two people have died, both in their 70s, in Santa Rosa and Lee counties. Forty five people have been infected here, most having either traveled or been in touch with someone who did. Nearly 150 tests are pending, with more cases certain to come.  DeSantis was all dark-suit-red-tie-slicked-hair calm, presenting the same staid tone he had all of the last week and a half, trying, like Trump, to reassure that the risk to the general public is low. But Thursday was clearly different.  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, gestures as he speaks during a news conference alongside Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, left, Lieutenant Governor Jeanette Nunez, second from right, and County Commissioner Esteban Bovo, right, at Jackson Memorial Hospital, Thursday, March 12, 2020, in Miami. [ WILFREDO LEE | AP ]  The cascade of delays, postponements and cancellations began in earnest a day before. State universities in Florida heeded orders to move classes online, scrapping in-person lectures. Nursing homes began to block, or at least heavily restrict, visitors.  Then came Tom Hanks, announcing he was sick in Australia, and NBA announcers with no games to call.  That’s when people started paying attention. Google searches rose in Tampa Bay for basic information that had been missed, or ignored, or was unclear as collective concern spread slowly. Denial had persisted even as Italy was shut down and the global case total ticked over 100,000. With coronavirus there were — and still are — so many unknowns. How could anyone keep track?  People pressed their concern into their keyboards, querying “coronavirus testing,” “current coronavirus numbers,” “coronavirus Trump,” “coronavirus update for Florida.”  Before late Wednesday, change had come slowly. Publix was bereft of hand sanitizer, and a big music festival was called off in Miami, but tourists in Orlando kept donning mouse ears at Walt Disney World and lawmakers didn’t shy from shaking hands and patting backs in Tallahassee. People slathered on sunscreen for crowded afternoons at the ballpark, traded business cards in glassy convention centers and sweated in leather as they rolled into Daytona Bike Week.  The state stripped those events of any innocence Wednesday night, when health officials announced a visitor to an emergency medical services conference in Tampa and another man who had planned to go to the annual motorcycle festival had tested positive for coronavirus.  After that, people woke up.  Thursday on Wall Street, stocks torpedoed more than on any single day in 32 years, seeding anxiety about a new recession. The travel industry saw layoffs and everywhere workers wondered if they could manage to take sick leave, or if the economy could withstand the virus.  Disney decided to close.  Officials in St. Petersburg, Hillsborough and Pasco declared local states of emergency.  Farnell Middle School and Tampa Prep closed in Hillsborough County over concerns about coronavirus exposure, along with Bishop Larkin Catholic School in Pasco. Kenny Chesney and Cher pushed back concerts in Tampa. So did the band America, because on Thursday, of course America was postponed.  Cigar City Brewing canceled its annual Hunahpu’s Day, which celebrates the release of a rare imperial stout.  In Tampa, Mayor Jane Castor announced the Hillsborough River would not be dyed green this weekend for the St. Patrick’s Day celebration. Maybe the city will hold the festivities in June instead.  “Clearly, bringing people together is the least responsible thing we can do at this point,” she said.  Amid the frenzy to clear calendars, the state announced another case: A 68-year-old man in Seminole County had tested positive.  The Department of Health sent out an alert, another drop in a torrent of information flowing to thousands of phones and television screens across Florida — so many people, now further apart, wondering the same thing.  What’s next?  The Rays dugout at Charlotte Sports Park could remain empty until next season after Thursday's announcement that spring training had been suspended indefinitely out of concern for the coronavirus.

       "'Eight new cases of the new coronavirus have been diagnosed in Florida, bringing the state’s total to 21, health officials said.  In an email sent late Tuesday, the Florida Department of Health said the new cases include seven Florida residents and a Georgia resident who is currently in Alachua County, Florida.

The new patients and the others who’ve tested positive in Florida are self-isolating for 14 days as instructed by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  On Tuesday night the Florida Department of Health announced eight new cases of coronavirus in the state.

Other cases involve a 22-year-old California woman who traveled to Italy with her sister and is self-isolating with her in Tampa, and a Georgia woman who will remain isolated in Alachua County until she is cleared by health officials. The Georgia Department of Public Health is leading the epidemiological investigation for her, the email said.  On Tuesday, officials announced that three employees of a company that greets cruise ship passengers in Fort Lauderdale tested positive for COVID-19, prompting officials to urge anyone who recently traveled through Port Everglades to isolate themselves for 14 days if they start experiencing symptoms, which include fever, a cough and shortness of breath.

As of Wednesday night, there are two confirmed cases of coronavirus in Florida and one case that has been classified as \"presumptive positive,\" which means the test is pending confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, according to the state Department of Health.  Gov. Ron DeSantis announced Wednesday that Florida had chalked up a fourth case of a resident, but the man is in isolation in Washington state and poses no threat to Florida residents.  12:01 p.m.  DeSantis said Thursday morning that a presumptive positive case of the new coronavirus has been identified in Santa Rosa County.  The affected individual is \"elderly with severe underlying conditions,\" DeSantis said. \"He had been doing international travel.

       "'Florida could be especially vulnerable to a coronavirus outbreak, both because of the large number of international travelers who visit during the winter months and because of the state’s large population of retirees. Given that the virus tends to be worse for older people, Mr. DeSantis said his administration was coordinating with assisted living facilities and nursing homes to make sure they were prepared.  “You absolutely need to take proper precautions about who’s being allowed in those facilities,” he said. His administration has also reached out to colleges and universities, asking students to stay out of class if they have traveled abroad for spring break to any of the affected countries.  “The risk to the general public is low,” Dr. Rivkees said. “Please go about your regular business.”  He urged people to stay home if they are sick, cough into their elbows and frequently wash their hands. People returning from countries where there is an outbreak should isolate themselves for two weeks upon their return, Dr. Rivkees said. If those people develop symptoms while at home, he said, they should call their county health department or medical provider to seek guidance on how to proceed.  The man infected with the virus in Manatee County was hospitalized for five days before he was tested, Dr. Rivkees said. He had underlying medical conditions, the governor said.  Medical workers who were in contact with the man have been asked to isolate themselves, Mr. DeSantis said. He added that the state is looking into waiving rules to allow out-of-state doctors and nurses to work in Florida temporarily if private hospitals experience shortages of health care workers.  The governor spent part of the day touring public health labs in Miami and Tampa that are conducting coronavirus testing. There is a third lab in Jacksonville. The facilities can turn around results in 24 to 48 hours. Patients do not have to pay for the tests.  So far, the state has tested 23 people for the new coronavirus.

       "'TAMPA, Fla. — A third person in Florida has tested positive for the novel coronavirus spreading across the globe.  The case of COVID-19 is in Hillsborough County and is the second case there. The latest presumptive positive case is the sister of the infected Hillsborough County woman who recently returned from Italy.  The other case is in Manatee County.  Two of the Florida cases have been confirmed, while the third made public Tuesday is awaiting confirmation from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  In a tweet by Helen Ferre, the spokeswoman for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, she said the governor “confirms a third presumptive #COVID19 case in Hillsborough; this individual resided with another who is confirmed as COVID-19.”  .@GovRonDeSantis confirms a third presumptive #COVID19  case in Hillsborough; this individual resided with another who is confirmed as COVID-19. — Helen Aguirre Ferré (@helenaguirrefer) March 3, 2020  Florida considers a case presumptively positive based on testing at one of the state’s three labs, then awaits confirmation from the CDC in Atlanta.  On Monday, Florida officials confirmed that two people had been infected with the novel coronavirus. One of the confirmed cases was identified as a man in his 60s from Manatee County who had not been to any of the countries currently identified for restricted travel by federal authorities, nor was he known to have been in contact with anyone who had traveled there.  The second confirmed patient is a woman in her 20s in Hillsborough County who had recently traveled to northern Italy — one of the areas identified for restricted travel due to the virus. The presumptive third case lived with the woman in Hillsborough.  DeSantis and other local officials on Monday said they were expecting more positive cases as more testing was conducted, and their focus was to contain its spread. As of Tuesday afternoon, 16 people in Florida who have been tested for coronavirus exposure were awaiting test results. There were another almost 250 under \"public health monitoring,\" which health officials defined as people under health official watch because they had contact with someone who tested positive, as well as people who have returned from China in the past 14 days.  The governor said his primary concern is the health and safety of infirm and elderly people in nursing homes, and he urged facilities to restrict visitors.  Meanwhile, facilities and organizations in the Bay area that attend to the needs of populations that appear to be especially vulnerable to the coronavirus, such as the elderly, are on high alert.  \"It\\'s very much about cleanliness, washing our hands, ensuring the time that we\\'re doing it correctly and doing it right, how often we\\'re doing it,\" said Nancy Clanton of Meridian Senior Living in Pinellas Park.  The Diocese of St. Petersburg has also taken steps to protect the health of parishoners. Leadership of the diocese has left decisions such as suspending distribution of the chalice during communion or holding hands during services up to individual pastors.  \"We don\\'t want to cause panic or go to extremes but we want to be careful. We want to be cautious,\" said Father Gary Dowsey of Our Lady of Lourdes Parish.  The spreading virus has placed health officials across the U.S. on high alert.  The absence of a clear protocol for sharing information between states became more apparent Tuesday, as Florida officials expressed irritation that New York health officials did not reach out to alert them about a 50-year-old lawyer who traveled to Miami and later tested positive. Florida officials said they learned about the case through the news media.  &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;'"

       "'(TNS) — Florida’s role in the race to prevent the new coronavirus from turning into an outbreak in the United States will be critical with the state’s vulnerable elderly population and the flood of international visitors.  Florida’s health officials say there are no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the state. But health care providers and government officials in Florida desperately want to get ahead of the new virus that originated in China and has spread to more than two dozen countries.  Florida hospitals are making preparations, researchers are scrambling to find treatments, and manufacturers are trying to create test kits that work. In China, where an outbreak has hit hard, frustrated medical workers complain of a shortage of masks and supplies and Florida wants to avoid a similar situation.  “Florida should be prepared to use our federal emergency response centers for masks, ventilators and things like that should it come to America, and that would fall on your committee to get that ball rolling,” John Sinnott, an infectious disease physician and professor at the University of South Florida and Tampa General Hospital, told Florida Senate Committee on Health Policy this week.  While still unclear how the virus spreads and whether it is airborne, Sinnott reminded Florida senators that COVID-19 is highly contagious What we do know, he said, is that one person infected with the coronavirus can spread it to an average of 2.2 people, compared to influenza, where one infected person can spread it to an average of 1.8 people.  Florida’s preparations  Florida Surgeon General Dr. Scott Rivkees said the Department of Health has put an incident management team in place and has several hundred members of his department in the state’s 67 counties ready to respond quickly. Rivkees said he also has asked health providers in Florida to take stock of their supplies and ensure they have ventilatory support equipment in preparation for the virus associated with an upper respiratory infection.  “According to the CDC [Centers for Disease Control & Prevention] the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. is viewed low, but we need to prepare for additional cases and the possibility of a foothold somewhere in U.S,” Rivkees told members of Florida’s Senate Committee on Health Policy this week.  Florida had hoped to begin testing people for COVID-19 by now at state laboratories in Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa. But the CDC said the test kits sent to states and intended to provide quick results proved faulty, and a manufacturer needs to remake them. While Florida’s health officials await the new kits, they will continue to send samples to the CDC lab in Atlanta, with results taking several days to process.  Under CDC criteria, anyone who has traveled to China within 14 days and shows symptoms of COVID-19 — cough, fever, shortness of breath — or an individual who has been in close contact with an infected person should notify the health department and get tested. Florida’s health department will test only people who fit that criteria, although the department may change that criteria if the illness spreads heavily in other countries.  One man’s experience  In Miami, one man’s efforts to get tested left him stuck with a big bill.  After traveling to Beijing for work, Osmel Martinez says more than two weeks later he developed what he thought might be symptoms of COVID-19: high fever, cough, muscle pains and weakness. He went to Jackson Memorial Hospital, spent an hour in the ER and had a blood test rather than the COVID-19 test when health officials ruled he didn’t meet testing criteria.  His illness ended up being the flu. Two weeks later Martinez says he received a bill for $3,270.  “This is a very serious and unpredictable virus that it should be screened, even if a small possibility that someone got infected,\" he said. “Instead the only public hospital in Miami is overcharging citizens for doing what I believed was the right thing to do.”  Jackson said Martinez was charged for emergency care and part of his tab is covered by insurance.  The process Jackson followed has been outlined by the CDC. Anyone who suspects they might have been exposed to COVID-19 should call the local health department before visiting their health provider. The person will be referred to a hospital that has been set up to handle COVID-19 testing and potential cases by taking samples and proper precautions, including possible quarantine of the sick individual.  Florida’s role in national preparations  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Friday it is working with state and local health departments to ready the public health workforce and prepare for a possible pandemic.  The agency is collaborating with supply chain partners, hospitals, pharmacies, manufacturers and distributors to understand the medical supplies needed to handle a surge in cases, and ensure strong infection-control methods are in place.  “We are not seeing community spread in the U.S. yet, but it’s possible, even likely, that it may eventually happen,” Dr. Nancy Messonnier, director of the National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said at a news briefing on Friday. “Our goal continues to be slowing the introduction of the virus into the U.S. This buys us more time to prepare our communities for more cases and possibly sustained spread.\"  Data from China shows the sick and elderly are most at risk. An additional reason Florida government officials say the state — with its large senior population — needs to be ready.  There is no vaccine or medication to treat COVID-19 at this time.  Messonnier pointed to China, where schools and businesses have been shuttered for weeks to contain the outbreak there, saying the U.S. may eventually need to do the same should a community see an outbreak.  The global threat  “People have come to the conclusion that it is very likely this virus will continue spreading throughout the world,” said Michael Mina, an infectious disease specialist and epidemiology professor at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. “So things have shifted from trying to stop its spread in China to now saying what can we do as a global community, as individual nations, or as individual hospitals, to prepare for what seems more and more inevitable.”  So far, more than 74,500 people are confirmed with COVID-19 in China. Globally an additional 600 people are infected, including 13 in the United States and another 634 on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, quarantined off the coast of Japan. On Friday, South Korea reported 100 new virus cases, bringing the total to 204 and raising concerns the outbreak there is getting out of control.  For now, the United States has adopted containment as its strategic response, limiting arrivals from China to 11 airports (none in Florida), isolating individuals with symptoms, and closely monitoring anyone who arrives in the United States who has been to China in the previous 14 days. If anyone from China without initial symptoms makes his way to Florida, health officials in the state follow up.  “The goal is containment and to stop person-to-person transmission,\" Rivkees told the Florida Senate committee. “If it does come, the idea is to slow the pace so it does not overwhelm the health care system.”  The race for answers  A South Florida researcher is part of the race to find answers about the new coronavirus. At Scripps Research in Jupiter, Dr. Hyeryun Choe has studied previous coronaviruses such as SARS. She is contributing her findings to help develop drugs, therapies and a possible vaccine.  “We have been working to identify the receptor that the virus uses to enter the cell,” Choe said.  Researchers must learn quickly whether COVID-19 spreads person-to-person, through the air, and whether it can linger on contaminated surfaces with the potential of infecting people.  “It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads,” according to the CDC’s website.  Florida’s medical experts advise avoiding close contact with anyone suspected of being infected. They also recommend individuals protect themselves by washing hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and disinfecting frequently touched surfaces using a household cleaning spray.  Meanwhile, groups around the world are working to find a therapy against the new coronavirus. They are testing anti-viral drugs, tailored proteins and a gene-silencing technique. They also are working to develop a vaccine for COVID-19.  Mina from Harvard said modern vaccines can be made more quickly, accurately and cheaper than a few years ago. “I do think we will be able to come up with a vaccine for this virus. But will it be available to a wider audience in the next year? I don’t think so.”  While researchers scramble to find treatments, the spread of COVID-19 continues in China, although at a slightly slower pace. “It’s becoming increasingly clear the quarantines in China have not necessarily served to stop the spread of this virus globally,” Mina said, “but they did probably slow it down considerably and buy the world some time.”  Making a plan  In Central Florida, where international tourists flood theme parks, U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Murphy of Winter Park called together airport officials, hospital executives and emergency workers this week to discuss preparedness. They discussed an emergency action plan that includes everything from how a person with a potential case of coronavirus would be transported to the hospital, to how to alert emergency workers so they are not exposed, to how and when to step up disinfecting efforts at theme parks and the airport.  “My hope is Florida will never have a confirmed case, but it’s best to be over-prepared,” Murphy said.

       "'What to Know Two people in Florida are the first to test positive for coronavirus  Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state was monitoring 184 people for COVID-19  DeSantis declared a statewide public health emergency on Sunday  Dozens of people in Florida were being monitored for potential coronavirus Monday after two people became the first in the state to test positive for the virus.  Officials with the Florida Department of Health said Monday that the CDC had confirmed the two cases of COVID-19 in the state.  Gov. Ron DeSantis said the state was monitoring 184 people for COVID-19. As on Monday, a total of 23 people have been tested in the state, including the two positive cases, 15 that came back negative, and six that were awaiting results, DeSantis said. Around 800 people in total have been monitored in the state since late January, DeSantis said.  \"Despite these cases the overall immediate threat to the public remains low. With that said, we do anticipate that more will test positive and we\\'ve taken additional actions to help contain the virus\\' spread,\" DeSantis said.  Miami-Dade commissioners are expected to address concerns over possible positive tests in the future in South Florida during a Tuesday meeting.  The two cases that tested positive in state labs involve a man in his 60s in Manatee County, and a woman in her 20s in Hillsborough County. Both were in stable condition and receiving medical care while being kept in isolation until they were medically cleared.  Officials said the woman had recently returned from northern Italy, which has been among the countries hardest hit by the virus outside of Asia. The man had not been in any countries affected, and it was unknown how he may have been exposed, officials said.  After being turned away by two Caribbean ports over fears of coronavirus, the MSC Cruises ship Meraviglia returned to Miami on Monday with a clean bill of health.  \"At the present time, it is not known how this individual was exposed to COVID-19,\" state health officer and surgeon general, Dr. Scott Rivkees, said at the news conference. \"This is a rapidly evolving situation.”  He directed anyone who has traveled to any of the high-risk countries to self-isolate for 14 days and notify public health officials. Officials didn\\'t say where the other people who had been tested were from in the state.  DeSantis met Monday morning with the chiefs of the state agencies that will be at the forefront of combating the virus, including the departments overseeing schools, prisons and elder care facilities. He was also scheduled to have a phone call with Vice President Mike Pence, who was appointed by President Donald Trump to lead the federal response to the widening crisis.  DeSantis declared a statewide public health emergency on Sunday, directing Rivkees, to take “any action necessary to protect the public health.\" Rivkees subsequently said his department was moving ahead with those plans while “working directly with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\" at the federal level and with local medical providers.  Health officials have confirmed a second coronavirus death within the United States. Washington state announced overnight that another patient with coronavirus, a man in his 70s with underlying health problems, has died. So far, at least 85 cases were confirmed within the United States since March 1, including the first cases in New York and Rhode Island.  Rivkee\\'s own statement said the immediate steps were being taken “to ensure these individuals receive the proper treatment and that anyone who has come into contact with them is following the necessary protocols, limiting or stopping any further spread.”  The governor designated the Florida Department of Health as the lead state agency to coordinate emergency responses and to actively monitor all those with apparent or suspected infections for a period of at least 14 days — or until tests turn up negative.  Three Florida Department of Health labs are now able to test for the new coronavirus, cutting wait times significantly for results, state officials had announced Saturday.  The Florida health officials said in an email that labs in Tampa, Jacksonville and Miami can conduct the tests, which previously had to be sent to federal labs. They said that would mean results should be available 24 to 48 hours afterward — instead of within days.  “The most important thing is it will bring down the average testing time,” said Deputy Health Secretary Shamarial Roberson in a telephone interview. “It helps address this in a more efficient time.”  Florida officials had been awaiting approval for one component of the test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Roberson said. That approval came Friday.  U.S. health officials updated the nation’s count of coronavirus cases to 91 on Monday.  For a coronavirus global tracker, click here.

       "'Gov. Ron DeSantis assures Florida residents that the risk to the general public is low. Still, people, officials on alert and preparing in Palm Beach County, elsewhere.  Keep calm and carry on.  This was the unified message Monday from the governor and the state’s top health official as the coronavirus officially landed in Florida.  Gov. Ron DeSantis said state officials received confirmation by afternoon from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that a man in his mid 60s from Manatee County and a woman in her 20s from Hillsborough County had tested positive for COVID-19.  \"Despite these cases, the overall immediate threat to the public remains low,\" said DeSantis, speaking at a news conference at the Florida Department of Health office in Miami-Dade County.  State Surgeon General, Dr. Scott Rivkees, cautioned residents not to panic. \"You can go about your normal business,\" he said.  Palm Beach County is on alert  There are no known cases in Palm Beach County, but officials remained on alert and residents started hoarding. Hand sanitizers and face masks were not easy to find.  >>Coronavirus: What Palm Beach County residents need to know  About 80 percent of the cases of this coronavirus are mild, 15 percent require a hospital stay and 5 percent could become severe.  Other than avoiding sick people, washing hands and staying if they’re home sick, people should \"go about their normal business,\" Rivkees added.  Still, it’s going to get a bit worse before it gets better.  \"We do anticipate that more will test positive and we\\'ve taken additional actions to help contain the virus\\' spread,\" DeSantis said.  >>Cerabino: Attention Floridians: Hands down, the best coronavirus advice you’ll ever get  It’s unknown how the Manatee County man, who reported to a hospital in Sarasota seeking treatment for pneumonia, contracted the virus. He remains hospitalized. The woman is isolation in her home in Hillsborough County.  Florida’s Health Department learned of the Manatee and Hillsborough cases Saturday evening, Rivkees said.  Besides the two people confirmed to have the virus, 21 others with connections to the two patients also have been tested, DeSantis said.  >>Coronavirus: Follow our LIVE updates  Of those, 15 came back negative, and six were awaiting results. The state also is \"monitoring\" 184 people who may have been exposed to the virus.  DeSantis confirmed that \"some\" employees at Doctors Hospital of Sarasota, where the confirmed Manatee County case of coronavirus is being treated, have been quarantined.  With the two confirmed cases, the state now is urging anyone who arrives from China, northern Italy, South Korea and Iran within the past 14 days to \"self-isolate\" at home for the next two weeks.  Stores in Palm Beach County seeing a rush for goods  Corbett McLarea, assistant manager at Hall Hardware in West Palm Beach, said the store is out of masks and ventilators even though he tells customers that masks won\\'t help but they order them anyway.  He points to the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic that killed millions. \"Look at the pictures from back then. What are they wearing? Masks. It didn\\'t do \\'em any good.\"  Hand sanitizer at some Publix supermarkets was nowhere to be found and face masks were going as fast as they were coming in at a nearby CVS drug store. Ventilators -- used by those in construction industry -- were nonexistent at some Home Depots.  At Palm Beach International Airport, the masks were the fashion accessory of the day.  >>READ: Gov. Ron DeSantis’ order for a state of emergency  Schools in Palm Beach County employed enhanced cleaning methods on campuses as well as in school kitchens for the next 30 days.  The scene at local colleges and universities  Local colleges and universities have also increased their vigilance.  Florida Atlantic University suspended its study abroad programs in China and South Korea last week after the CDC issued travel advisories covering those hard-hit countries.  Emergency medicine physician residents at FAU’s college of medicine planned to hold a mock disaster scenario.  >>\\'This is not sustainable\\': Public health departments, decimated by funding cuts, scramble against coronavirus  Palm Beach Atlantic University produced a video to give students, faculty and parents information about the virus and to help prevent its spread.  Keiser University is strongly advising students to not travel to areas with significant outbreaks during spring break.  Those who get a fever, cough and shortness of breath should immediately contact their county health department then see their doctor.  Procedures are in place for health care  Health care workers and hospitals are ready, officials say. The state health department has been holding weekly conference calls to ensure respiratory precautions are in place with enough equipment to protect workers.  State labs in Tampa, Miami and Jacksonville are approved for testing.  \"The thing that worries me the most is the overloading of our health care system, our emergency response system and our ICUs,\" said Mike Farzan, a professor in the Department of Immunology at Scripps Research Institute in Jupiter.  Another concern is that health officials don’t know how the Manatee County patient contracted the virus, an indication that there could be others in the area with the disease going undiagnosed.  \"I would only say there is a potential for a cluster,\" he said.  Farzan was part of the team the unlocked the mysteries of SARS virus in 2003. He said this is the same type of virus with the same way of infecting cells.  Still, a new vaccine is needed to thwart it, which could take at least six months.  For the time being, the best medicine is isolation. It won’ t be easy for families as caregivers, especially of little children.  \"Keep a mask on you and a mask on them and keep wiping down surfaces,\" Farzan said. \"It’s a hell of an ask. The main thing a parent has to know is this is not a choice between no attention and doing everything.\"  Outbreak comes at peak of South Florida’ tourism season  The outbreak comes at an awkward moment for Florida’s tourism industry. With colleges on spring break and baseball spring training in full swing, March is the peak of South Florida’s tourist season.  In an email to tourism businesses Monday, Visit Florida, the state’s public-private marketing arm, noted that federal health officials have recommended no restrictions on travel within the United States.  \"According to the Florida Department of Health, the risk to the public in Florida remains low,\" Visit Florida said in the email.  Office Depot, the international retailer based in Boca Raton, said it’s no longer sending employees to China.  The concern is with nursing homes, whose populations are at risk  In Washington state the front lines of the virus turned out to be a nursing home.  The industry in Florida was quelling fears among its members that its elderly population could be at risk.  Veronica Catoe, the CEO at Florida Assisted Living Association in Jacksonville, said operators called wanting to stop visitation and to monitor the body temperature of workers.  \"Everybody’s very concerned about the coronavirus and somewhat being over-reactive,\" said Catoe, whose organization has 700 ALF members.  She said if you are sick, don’t visit a loved one in an ALF or nursing home, pretty much standard protocol for when there isn’t a pandemic.  If one wanted to see the front lines of the coronovirus panic, Palm Beach County International Airport was the place to people watch.  Arthur Damm wore a facemask on his flight home to West Palm Beach because he just beat back pneumonia.  \"The doctor advised that because my lungs are not fully healed, that I should definitely wear a mask on an airplane and in the airport,\" 71-year-old Damm said.  His wife Janette, on the other hand, didn’t bother wearing a mask on the plane.  \"I didn’t think it was necessary,\" the 66-year-old said. \"I think there’s a lot of hype about it.\"  Reporters Hannah Morse, Wayne Washington and Jeff Ostrowski contributed to this story.  jmilian@pbpost.com  @caneswatch  jpacenti@pbpost.com  @jpacenti  cpersaud@pbpost.com  @chrispersaud'"

       "'Florida could be especially vulnerable to a coronavirus outbreak, both because of the large number of international travelers who visit during the winter months and because of the state’s large population of retirees. Given that the virus tends to be worse for older people, Mr. DeSantis said his administration was coordinating with assisted living facilities and nursing homes to make sure they were prepared.  “You absolutely need to take proper precautions about who’s being allowed in those facilities,” he said. His administration has also reached out to colleges and universities, asking students to stay out of class if they have traveled abroad for spring break to any of the affected countries.  “The risk to the general public is low,” Dr. Rivkees said. “Please go about your regular business.”  He urged people to stay home if they are sick, cough into their elbows and frequently wash their hands. People returning from countries where there is an outbreak should isolate themselves for two weeks upon their return, Dr. Rivkees said. If those people develop symptoms while at home, he said, they should call their county health department or medical provider to seek guidance on how to proceed.  The man infected with the virus in Manatee County was hospitalized for five days before he was tested, Dr. Rivkees said. He had underlying medical conditions, the governor said.  Medical workers who were in contact with the man have been asked to isolate themselves, Mr. DeSantis said. He added that the state is looking into waiving rules to allow out-of-state doctors and nurses to work in Florida temporarily if private hospitals experience shortages of health care workers.  The governor spent part of the day touring public health labs in Miami and Tampa that are conducting coronavirus testing. There is a third lab in Jacksonville. The facilities can turn around results in 24 to 48 hours. Patients do not have to pay for the tests.  So far, the state has tested 23 people for the new coronavirus. The two positive results, which were first obtained by state labs, were confirmed on Monday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.'"

       "'Jeffrey Schweers  USA TODAY NETWORK-Florida Capital Bureau  The coronavirus public health emergency declared late Sunday by Gov. Ron DeSantis gives broad powers to Scott Rivkees, the state’s secretary of health and surgeon general, to respond to the crisis.  Fifteen Floridians have been tested, with two people in the Tampa Bay area coming up “presumptively” positive for the COVID-19 virus, leading the governor to issue an executive order declaring a public health emergency.  Rivkees is “authorized to use his judgment as to the duration of this public health emergency” and is “authorized to take any action necessary to protect the public health.”  The major part of that will be to follow U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines to control the spread of COVID-19 and educate the public on prevention measures. Any action taken by Rivkees, the state health officer, now is immediately enforceable by law enforcement.  That includes arresting anyone and charging them with a second-degree misdemeanor for violating any isolation or quarantine or any other rules or orders imposed under the public health emergency order.  The Department of Health also is the lead state agency to coordinate emergency response activities with other state and local government agencies, including the Department of Education, Elder Affairs, Children and Families and the Division of Emergency Management.  The DOH will actively monitor people with symptoms of COVID-19, or “persons under investigation” are isolated or quarantined for 14 days or until they test negative for the virus.  Under Florida Statutes, a public health emergency means any threat that can cause “substantial injury or harm to the public health from infectious disease, chemical agents, nuclear agents, biological toxins, or situations involving mass casualties or natural disasters.”  The public health emergency lasts until Rivkees finds the threat has been contained or eliminated. “However, a declaration of a public health emergency may not continue for longer than 60 days unless the Governor concurs in the renewal of the declaration,” the law says.  Under a public health emergency, Rivkees can order any individual to be examined and tested for communicable diseases that have a high mortality rate and present a severe danger to public health. Those who refuse can be quarantined or isolated.  If there is no practical method to isolate or quarantine the individual, Rivkees can use any means necessary to vaccinate or treat the individual.  According to Florida law, quarantine means the \"separation of an individual reasonably believed to have been exposed to a communicable disease, but who is not yet ill, from individuals who have not been so exposed, to prevent the possible spread of the disease.\"  The order also gives Rivkees broad enforcement authority, including the power to apply for injunctions and issue warrants to make people comply with his orders, as outlined in law.  Also, he can reactivate the inactive licenses of retired physicians, physician assistants, licensed practical nurses, registered nurses, and advanced practice registered nurses, respiratory therapists and emergency medical technicians and paramedics as long as they are in good standing.  And he can direct manufacturers of prescription drugs or over-the-counter drugs and wholesalers of prescription drugs located in Florida to give priority to shipping of specified drugs to pharmacies and health care providers.  Also, he can direct pharmacists employed by the department to compound bulk prescription drugs and provide these bulk prescription drugs to physicians and nurses of county health departments or any qualified person authorized for administration to persons as part of a prophylactic or treatment regimen.  The rules adopted by the Department of Health under a public health emergency supersede all rules enacted by other state departments, boards and commissions, and local ordinances.  Anyone who violates any rule, any isolation or quarantine, or \"any requirement adopted by the department pursuant to a declared public health emergency can be charged with a second degree misdemeanor.\"  Contact Jeff Schweers at jschweers@gannett.com and follow him on Twitter @jeffschweers.

       "'The response to coronavirus got real this week.  Events from golf and basketball tournaments to St. Patrick’s Day celebrations and other social gatherings have been canceled. Some schools and theme parks are closing. Grocery stores have seen a rush of people stocking up in ways reminiscent of hurricane season.  And confirmed cases continue to crop up in the Tampa Bay area, Florida and worldwide. Early Saturday, state officials announced 25 new COVID-19 patients — the most announced at one time since the pandemic started. There are now more than 70 confirmed cases in Florida and rising.  Though state officials say the threat to the public remains low, public interest in learning about the disease — how it works, who is most at risk — grows higher.  Here are the answers to some common questions. Got more? Email kvarn@tampabay.com, message the Tampa Bay Times on Facebook or reply to us on Twitter.  You can also stay up to date with our new 10-minute podcast, Coronavirus in Florida. We’ll talk to experts and reporters, share the facts behind the spread of the virus and discuss what could happen next.  The latest on cases  Q: Have the number of coronavirus cases been increasing in Florida?  A: Yes. There are now more than 70 cases. There have also been three deaths. The latest is a 68-year-old Orlando area woman who visited South Korea, then fell ill in California. She died before returning to Florida. Our latest on all the positive tests can be found here and here is a map and other details about all the cases.  The total number of people in Florida who have tested positive and negative for the disease can also be found on the Florida Department of Health website.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the World Health Organization are also tracking the disease in the U.S. and internationally.  Q: What is the latest in the Tampa Bay area?  A: Six people in the Tampa Bay area have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, including a 49-year-old Hillsborough woman whose positive test was announced late Thursday night.  There are two cases in Pinellas County, three in Hillsborough County and one in Pasco County.  Q: Do we know the identities of any of the local people who have tested positive?  A: We know one. The man who tested positive in Pasco County announced it on his business Facebook page, then talked to the Times. That story can be found here.  Q: Has the Times spoken to anyone who has traveled from high-risk areas back to this area?  A: Yes. We spoke to a nurse who was quarantined, then made his way to Spain, London and eventually Tampa. His assessment: “The farther west I went, the less and less concerned people seemed to be.” Read his full story here.  Changes, closures and cancellations  Q: There’s a presidential primary election on Tuesday in Florida. What’s the latest?  A: The outbreak of the coronavirus is forcing Pinellas and Hillsborough counties to move additional polling places for Tuesday’s presidential preference primary election. Read our full report here.  Q: What about the Firestone Grand Prix St. Petersburg? Still going on as scheduled?  A: The race was canceled late Friday morning. Earlier plans were to run the race without spectators but now it’s off altogether. Full story here.  Q: What about WrestleMania?  A: WrestleMania 36, scheduled for April 5 at Raymond James Stadium, is still on for now ... but stay tuned. A county emergency policy team hasn’t made a final decision.  Q: Has this affected other sporting events?  A: It sure has. PGA announced Friday it would postpone the Masters Tournament. The Valspar Championship is canceled. MLB on Thursday suspended spring training and pushed Opening Day back two weeks. The NHL and NBA seasons have been suspended indefinitely. The Tampa Bay Rowdies’ season has been halted and MLS also is shutting down for 30 days. The American Athletic Conference, in which USF plays, announced late Thursday morning it has canceled its men’s basketball tournament in Fort Worth, Texas. The Tampa Bay Bucs also discontinued travel for scouts, coaches and staff due to coronavirus.  Here’s a full run down of what’s happened.  Q: What about theme parks like Disney and Busch Gardens?  A: Florida’s theme parks (Walt Disney World, Universal, Busch Gardens, SeaWorld, Adventure Island and Legoland) said they will close for two weeks starting Monday. Full story here.  Disney’s resorts and Disney Springs will remain open, according to an announcement on the company website.  Q: What about the courts? Do people still have to go to jury duty?  A: The Florida Supreme Court ordered that all face-to-face legal proceedings across the state cease for the next two weeks. Read the full story here.  Q: What’s going on with religious services?  A: The Catholic Diocese of St. Petersburg issued a dispensation for mass services. The Times has also heard of several Tampa Bay area churches that have canceled live gatherings and are moving to video streaming. For example, Hyde Park United Methodist in Tampa has suspended all worship services and gatherings but will stream their 9:30 and 11 a.m. Sunday services on Facebook. The church’s ministry feeding the homeless will continue in the church parking lot on Azeele Street. That starts at 7:15 a.m. Sunday.  Check with your religious institution before heading to regularly scheduled services.  Q: What about conventions that were scheduled in Tampa? Are they being canceled?  A: It’s under consideration, especially with the fact that someone who attended a conference of emergency medical personnel in Tampa last week fell ill with the disease.  Q: Is there any chance other area events may be canceled?  A: Gov. Ron DeSantis on Thursday urged cities and counties in Florida to postpone or cancel any mass gatherings over the next 30 days in an effort to limit the spread of coronavirus. Here’s our full story on what he said here.  Citing concerns over the coronavirus, organizers have canceled the 2020 Tampa Bay AirFest scheduled for the weekend of March 28-29. Tampa’s River O’ Green and St. Patrick’s Day parade also has been postponed.  The city of St. Petersburg and city of Tampa governments said they are both closely monitoring the virus.  Performance venues, like the Straz and Ruth Eckerd Hall, have canceled all events.  The state science fair was canceled and Ultra Music Festival in Miami was canceled.  St. Petersburg’s Museum of Fine Arts has temporarily closed and the the 23rd Annual Art in Bloom and related events set for March 2630 have been canceled.  Meanwhile, officials in Austin, Texas, have canceled the South by Southwest festival, where some Tampa Bay artists had been scheduled to appear.  Our ongoing full list of cancellations is here.  And this story does a great job summing up just what kind of a day it was on Thursday when so much was canceled.  Q: Is anything still going on?  A: Yes. Here’s a list of events still happening the this weekend.  What about Publix?  A: The Lakeland company said its supermarkets will close early at 8 p.m. starting Saturday. The company said it needs time to stock shelves and sanitize stores.  Travel  Q: Is traffic at Tampa International Airport being affected?  A: Yes. The airport says that spring break traffic is down and they don’t expect to break records as they have over the last several years.  Q: Is airline travel particularly unsafe?  A: While the disease certainly spreads during travel, planes may not be the sick factories we think. In fact, only those seated close to an infected person are at even medium risk. Read our full story about this here.  Q: What about going on cruises?  A: Major cruises have been delayed coming into port because of positive or pending coronavirus cases on board. On Sunday, the State Department issued a warning against traveling by cruise ship. The CDC said risk of infection is higher on a cruise because of the close quarters. The Regal Princess cruise ship finally pulled into a Florida port and passengers began disembarking after two crew members tested negative for coronavirus.  Meanwhile, coronavirus has led Tampa cruise lines to ease cancellation policies. And some Florida cases have been linked to cruises on the Nile River.  Q: I heard someone with COVID-19 came through Tampa International Airport. What do we know?  A: A spokeswoman for the airport announced March 2 that a woman in her 20s who had traveled to northern Italy and was later diagnosed with COVID-19 flew through the airport.  A woman who was on that flight tells the Tampa Bay Times that the response she has seen from her health department has been ‘unacceptable.’  Schools  Q: Have any Tampa Bay area schools closed?  A: All schools in Florida will close for a week in addition to regularly scheduled spring breaks. For Tampa Bay area schools, that means students will be off for spring break the week of March 16, then another week off starting March 23. Full story here.  Q: What else should I know about spring break?  Tampa Bay schools are asking students and parents to inform the district about certain travel plans and other conditions before returning to school after spring break. Full story here.  Q: How are colleges reacting?  Florida higher education leaders on Wednesday directed all state universities to move classes online as soon as possible.  Schools should offer remote, online teaching while keeping campuses open and operations regular for students who don’t have the option to relocate, The Board of Governors for the State University System said.  Eckerd College, a private school in Pinellas County, also will close dorms and extend spring break through March 29, then will move classes online. Nova Southeastern University is suspending classes until March 23 then will move online.  Senior care and nursing homes  Q: Who is most at risk?  A: Dr. Sally Alrabaa, an infectious disease specialist with the USF Health Morsani College of Medicine, said unlike other outbreaks, coronavirus seems to be most severe for the elderly and people with health issues. There have not been many reports of severe issues in children and healthy adults.  Q: What is being done to protect senior citizens?  A: If COVID-19 spreads, the elderly are most at risk to suffer the most severe symptoms, including death — and no state has a higher share of residents in their 70s, 80s or older than Florida.  CDC recommendations for senior citizens remain the same as for the rest of the population. The World Health Organization recommends people over 60 avoid crowded areas.  Nursing homes and other elder care facilities are of particular concern. The CDC has a pandemic planning checklist for long-term care and residential health facilities.  Tampa Meals on Wheels is preparing multi-day food packs in case one of the people they deliver to has to self-isolate for 14 days.  Q: I’ve heard reports of some nursing homes not allowing visits. Is that happening?  A: Facilities are expected to take visitors’ temperatures and ask questions about their contacts and travels. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis has issued an executive order preventing large groups of people from visiting nursing homes, assisted-living facilities and similar sites in Florida in an effort to stop the spread of novel coronavirus among some of the state’s most vulnerable people.  Anyone who’s traveled internationally, sailed on a cruise ship, exhibits symptoms of coronavirus or has been in contact with someone who tested positive for the virus is temporarily prohibited from visiting those sites, he said.  The Times spoke with some family members of people in nursing homes, who said they are worried but understand the restrictions. Full story here.  The Times’ Leonora LaPeter Anton also wrote about her own experience with these restrictions at her father’s memory care facility. Read her heartbreaking account here.  Q: Will getting the pneumonia vaccine help seniors handle coronavirus any better?  A: Dr. Seetha Lakshmi, an infectious disease physician at Tampa General Hospital, said it could. “I encourage all my patients to make sure they are updated on vaccinations, including the annual flu shot and the pneumonia vaccine.”  Other vulnerable groups  Q: Are first-responders like firefighters and paramedics taking precautions?  A: Yes, they are. In fact, residents shouldn’t be alarmed if they see first-responders wearing gloves, gowns and masks. They’re just taking the proper precautions. Here’s our full story on this here.  Q: Are doctors or nurses getting sick?  A: About 80 nurses across the country have been quarantined due to COVID-19 exposure and a local nurse with more than 30 years of experience tells us: “This is the most serious thing I’ve been through personally.\"  Q: There are a lot of veterans in the Tampa Bay area and Florida. Are there special services for veterans who think they may have coronavirus?  A: Yes. Veterans health officials are encouraging veterans who believe they’ve come down with the coronavirus to call a toll-free number for a preliminary diagnosis and to prepare for a trip to a medical center or clinic. The number is 1-877-741-3400. More information here.  Q: Are Florida prisons still allowing visits?  No. Inmates will no longer be able to receive visitors in Florida’s prisons, the Department of Corrections announced Wednesday night. Full story here.  Q: Are all the updates being communicated with Floridians who don’t speak English?  A: Though government agencies broadly recognize the need to translate their messages into Spanish, Health Department offices were struggling to adapt this philosophy to the growing health concern. Read our full story about this here.  Q: What about hourly or contract workers?  Many companies with workers who don’t usually get sick time — like Uber and Instacart — are re-evaluating their sick leave policies, though challenges remain.  Pets and animals  Q. Can pets get coronavirus?  The virus is thought to have originated from an animal source, but according to the World Health Organization, there is no evidence that pets such as cats and dogs have been infected or could spread the coronavirus.  However, since animals can spread diseases to people, CDC recommends washing hands after being around animals.  Understanding the virus  Q: What are the symptoms?  A: Common symptoms are fever, cough and shortness of breath. These symptoms may appear from two to 14 days after exposure to the virus.  Symptoms have ranged from mild to severe, but health officials recommend you call a doctor if you develop symptoms and have been to a country where coronavirus has been widespread, like Italy or China.  In severe cases, mainly with older patients, coronavirus can lead to pneumonia.  Also, keep in mind we’re in peak allergy season. Experts said allergies can be distinguished from something more serious, because allergies don’t come with fever.  Q: How does it compare to the standard flu?  A: Both have about the same level of infection, Alrabaa said, meaning if you meet someone with the flu and someone with coronavirus you have about the same odds of getting infected. She said influenza is more deadly but that coronavirus has a more severe effect on older people.  Q: Can I use antibiotics to treat or prevent coronavirus?  A: No. Antibiotics are not effective for a virus.  Q: Can the virus be passed through water sources?  A: No. The CDC says the virus spreads from person to person in close contact, within about six feet. Alrabaa said it can’t spread through water systems in buildings or cities, and instead passes through respiratory droplets from someone or from droplets they leave on a surface.  According to the CDC, “the COVID-19 virus has not been detected in drinking water. Conventional water treatment methods that use filtration and disinfection, such as those in most municipal drinking water systems, should remove or inactivate the virus that causes COVID-19.”  Tampa Bay Water — the water provider for Pinellas, Hillsborough, Pasco, St. Petersburg, Tampa and New Port Richey utility customers — issued a news release saying tap water remains safe to drink. Customers with questions can call 866-463-6420.  Q: Should I wear a mask?  A: Probably not. The World Health Organization recommends only people with coronavirus or those caring for them wear masks. Masks are only effective if worn properly and in combination with proper hand washing. If needed, the WHO has a guide on how to properly put on and remove masks.  The U.S. Surgeon General also sent out a Tweet telling people to stop buying masks because they’re not effective for the general public and could make it harder for health officials to access supplies they need.  However, that didn’t stop a Tampa strip club from offering 10,000 masks to customers.  Q: How does the virus spread? Can it live on an object shipped from China?  A: The disease spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. It can also be picked up on surfaces, but the CDC said that doesn’t seem to be the primary way it spreads.  The CDC said there is little risk of objects being shipped from China carrying coronavirus because the virus has a poor chance of surviving on a surface shipped over the course of several days or weeks at an ambient temperature. There are no cases in the U.S. associated with imported goods.  Q: Is there any chance the spread of the virus will slow soon?  A: Alrabaa said there will likely be more cases before things slow down. DeSantis also said there will likely be more positive cases in Florida. The CDC said it’s unknown whether the spread of the disease will change when the weather gets warmer.  Q: Can the coronavirus’s spread be stopped?  The World Health Organization declared the coronavirus a “pandemic” on Wednesday.  But that doesn’t mean that measures like social distancing, vigilant hand-washing and in some cases, self-isolating, can’t make a difference.  \"All countries can still change the course of this pandemic” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who heads the U.N. agency. “If countries detect, test, treat, isolate, trace and mobilize their people in the response.”  Q: I’ve been hearing the term ‘community spread’ ... what the heck is that?  A: \"Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected,” according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been some dispute about whether community spread has occurred in Florida. Listen to our podcast about community spread, and for a full glossary of other coronavirus terms, go here.  Q: Is Florida more vulnerable to coronavirus than other states?  A: Yes. Experts believe it is, citing the state’s large number of seniors and those who are uninsured. Our full story on this topic is here.  Q: Will the warming springtime temperatures in Florida affect how the disease spreads?  A: Experts hope warming temperatures — and we’re expecting the 80s starting this week — could slow the spread, as viruses like these typically spread more in cold weather, when people gather more indoors and heating systems dry out our systems.  But experts also warn that so little is known about the virus, there’s not enough evidence to expect the spread to weaken. So don’t count on returning fully to normal by summer. Full story here.  Understanding the response  Q: How does testing work? What should I do if I think I need to be tested?  A: The Florida Department of Health can now test for coronavirus in Tampa, Jacksonville and Miami within 48 hours. CDC testing takes up to five days, according to DeSantis.  Health officials advise to call ahead to a doctor or health department if you suspect you have coronavirus so they can prepare for your arrival and limit the risk of infecting others.  You can also visit the doctor virtually. Many hospital systems have the option, which lets doctors give you advice and can keep people out of the ER if it’s not needed.  To contact the health department directly, call 866-779-6121 or email COVID-19@flhealth.gov.  “We’re not recommending the average citizen if they start coughing to show up in the emergency room,\" DeSantis said.  Q. What is the latest with testing?  State labs in Miami, Jacksonville and Tampa have run nearly 400 tests, with more than 150 of those still awaiting results. Read more about the process here.  Q: How much will it cost me if I get tested?  A: As of now, if you’re seen at an emergency room or urgent care center, you would likely pay what you ordinarily would based on your insurance plan or lack thereof. It is not immediately clear if the amount would be different at a Department of Health office.  Q: How ready is Florida’s health department for the coronavirus?  Even before the coronavirus outbreak in Florida, the state health department said it needed more resources to handle emerging infectious disease threats. The Department of Health is straining to keep up after years of staff cuts.  Gov. Ron DeSantis and lawmakers appear poised to boost the state’s response to the virus outbreak with $25 million in state funding, but experts say that won’t make up for years of underfunding that have eroded the agency’s readiness.  Q: Are local hospitals preparing?  A: Yes. “We’re in a much better status than some of these countries to take care of ill patients,” Alrabaa said. She said all hospitals in the community have a task force and have dealt with respiratory issues from a virus before. BayCare Health Systems announced Friday it will be screening visitors to its health centers for coronavirus.  Q: The Tampa Bay Times has a pay gateway, so I can only read a limited number of articles about this public health crisis, right?  A: All our stories about coronavirus are not behind our pay gateway, so you can access all of them for free. The Times does this in times of crisis or emergency, including hurricanes. If you’re valuing all our coverage and would like to subscribe, you can do so here.  Q: I heard Florida Sen. Rick Scott has gone into quarantine?  A: Yes. Scott announced Thursday he will self-quarantine after having possible contact with Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro’s press secretary Fabio Wajngarten during a meeting in Florida this week.  Q: I heard something about Florida requiring people who have flown internationally to go into quarantine or isolation. Is that true?  A: No. The state Department of Health put out an advisory declaring that earlier Monday, but pulled that recommendation back after several hours. Currently, only people who have traveled to China, Italy, Iran and South Korea should self-isolate.  Q: I’m hearing a lot of rumors ... how do I know what’s true?  A: As with any emerging news, wild claims and misinformation can spread fear and confusion. False posts online have already distorted symptoms of the virus and peddled miracle cures. We’ve debunked a few myths.  Stay informed by following trusted news sources. Members of the public are urged to follow the advice of established institutions like WHO and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and to beware of claims suggesting ways to prevent the virus.  Economic and business impact  Q: Have the markets been effected?  A: Yes, they have. In fact, Thursday was the worst day on Wall Street since 1987 as virus fears spread.  Q: How should workplaces prepare for the virus?  A: The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends companies keep a flexible sick leave policy and encourage employees to stay home even for minor respiratory illness or a slight fever.  For businesses that rely on temporary or contract employees without sick time, the CDC says to develop “non-punitive leave policies.” If an employee shows up coughing or sneezing, separate them from their coworkers and send them home sick or to work remotely.  Employers should also remind staff of hygiene etiquette, ensure the workplace is sanitized regularly and provide wipes or cleaning supplies, keep track of employees who are traveling and prepare an infectious disease outbreak response plan.  If public officials move to recommend people maintain a physical distance from each other, plan how your business will respond. Will it stagger shifts to decrease people’s contact with one another or offer flexible work hours and telecommuting options?  Q: Are there any Tampa Bay businesses struggling?  A: We talked to one business owner whose plight has become “a case study in the ways that the mushrooming coronavirus pandemic is creating havoc and doubt for many small businesses that rely on imports.” Our full story is here.  Q: Are people staying at home and using delivery services more?  A: Yes. Rather than go to the grocery store, some people are increasingly outsourcing the task to delivery drivers who are managing a surge of large orders. Full story here.  Prepare yourself  Q: How can I protect myself?  A: Avoid touching your face, cover sneezes and coughs with a tissue, and wash hands frequently for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren’t around, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60 percent alcohol.  Clean items you frequently touch often and thoroughly. These include your phone, phone case, counter tops, door knobs and keyboards. Use a cleaning spray or wipe. Also wash dishes thoroughly and avoid sharing them with others.  Q: Should I stop shaking hands with people?  A: Yes. Try a bow or an elbow-bump as a greeting instead. Experts say keeping some distance in social interactions can help prevent the spread of the virus.  As we found out in this story, churches and local law groups are encouraging people to avoid shaking hands during gatherings.  Q: Does using public transportation, going to events with large crowds or traveling put me at risk?  A: Alrabaa said avoiding crowded places reduces the risk of catching any illness. Frequent hand washing and good hygiene reduce that risk.  “The reality is anything people touch has some sort of a germ on it,” she said.  Q: I guess I should stock up in case the virus spreads further. What belongs in a quarantine home kit?  A: You don’t need to raid the grocery store, but experts recommend keeping a two-week supply of non-perishable food for everyone in your home in case you need to self-isolate, so that you can avoid going out. That could include rice, pasta, beans, oats, canned foods, snacks and bottled water.  Here’s our in-depth shopping list.  Keep cleaning supplies in stock, like laundry detergent, antibacterial soap, and hand sanitizer with at least 60-percent alcohol contact. Don’t forget hygiene items like diapers, toilet paper and feminine care products.  Make sure you have at least a 30-day supply of prescription medication and keep electronic records of health records from doctors and hospitals. Make a list of emergency contacts.  Q: I heard Publix is limiting the number of some items that people can buy. Is that true?  A: Yes, it is. Publix is limiting customers to only two of some items, including soap, hand sanitizer, wipes and other items. Full story here.  Reasons for hope  Q: Is there any good news?  A: There is. Amid all the fears, quarantines and stockpiling of food, it has been easy to ignore the fact that more than 60,000 people have recovered from the coronavirus spreading around the globe. Full story here. And coronavirus has resulted in gas prices plunging below $2 a gallon in some places around the Tampa Bay area.  Q: I’m feeling mentally and emotionally exhausted. What can I do?

       "'EMBED >More News Videos As many were observed less than six feet from others, experts urge Philadelphians to keep their social distance.  HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Gov. Tom Wolf put another 2.5 million Pennsylvania residents under an order that restricts people from leaving home Friday, as his administration confirmed more coronavirus cases and deaths and major facilities were enlisted to help with hospital overflows.Wolf, in a statement, added nine counties to 10 already covered by the order, for a total of 19 counties and three-fourths of the state\\'s 12.8 million residents.The stay-at-home order starts at 8 p.m. Friday for Berks, Butler, Lackawanna, Lancaster, Luzerne, Pike, Wayne, Westmoreland and York counties, and will last until at least April 6.The stay-at-home order restricts movement to certain health or safety-related travel, or travel to a job at an employer designated by Wolf\\'s administration as \"life-sustaining.\"Wolf already issued such an order for the suburban Philadelphia counties, while the city has its own stay at home order in place.The measures are designed to slow the spread of the virus and give the state\\'s hospitals time to increase its staffing, equipment and bed space.There is no curfew, and no reports of police arrests for someone breaking the order. City officials under the order have generally said that enforcement is focused on letting people know about it, breaking up crowds or closing public areas to prevent people from gathering.Wolf issued the first stay-at-home order Monday, a day after Philadelphia issued its own, and Health Secretary Rachel Levine said it\\'s not clear yet whether the orders are effective.\"They haven\\'t been in place long enough,\" Levine said at a news conference Friday. \"It\\'ll take weeks and weeks to see the effect.\"Those new counties became candidates for the order as increases in confirmed coronavirus cases there grew to a \"significant level and we have evidence of community spread,\" Levine said.Even before Friday, Wolf had closed schools statewide, urged people statewide to stay home and ordered thousands of \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses to close, an order that has drawn lawsuits in federal and state courts.Levine said those orders won\\'t be relaxed until there is a consistent decline in the number of new cases that shows the measures are slowing the spread of the virus.\"We\\'re not there yet,\" Levine said.Meanwhile, Wolf signed a package of coronavirus-related legislation that passed the Legislature earlier this week.A look at coronavirus-related developments in Pennsylvania:___CASESWolf\\'s administration said on Friday it had confirmed more than 530 new cases, a 30% jump to more than 2,200, and six more deaths for a total of 22.More counties, 50 of the state\\'s 67 counties, are seeing their first coronavirus cases, while at least 17 nursing homes have reported a case, according to the state Department of Health.Locally, the number of positive cases is currently:Berks - 65Bucks - 124Chester - 107Delaware - 185Lehigh - 93Montgomery - 374Northampton - 79Philadelphia - 637More than 1,300 of Pennsylvania\\'s confirmed coronavirus cases, or 60%, are in Philadelphia or its four suburban counties, and health care officials say they worry that hospitals there are two weeks away from being in the same situation as New York City\\'s hospitals.For most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, or death.___CONGRESSMAN TESTS POSITIVEU.S. Rep. Mike Kelly of Butler County said Friday that he tested positive for the coronavirus.In a statement, Kelly said he began experiencing flu-like symptoms and talked to his doctor, who ordered a test for COVID-19.His test came back positive Friday afternoon. His symptoms are mild, he said. He was at home and was not in Washington for the vote on the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package.___HOSPITAL SPACEPhiladelphia Mayor Jim Kenney said Friday that the city has reached an agreement with Temple University to use the Liacouras Center and possibly other Temple facilities for overflow hospital space, including the pavilion and parking garage.The Liacouras Center is a 10,000-seat multi-purpose center and will be able to handle at least 250 patients at first. City officials say they are moving quickly to get supplies and the physical aspects of the facility set up.Meanwhile, a shuttered reform school for boys in suburban Philadelphia may be used as a medical overflow facility.The Glen Mills School has medical and dental facilities, an air field, a generator and a more than 85,000 square-foot athletic facility that could host patients from hospitals and other health care facilities.Tim Boyce, executive director of Delaware County\\'s Emergency Management Agency, told WPVI-TV in Philadelphia that the Glen Mills School will start with 250 beds, but could be expanded.Wolf\\'s administration said Friday that the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, along with federal and local government agencies, is assessing a number of sites across the state to become housing or medical facilities. No plans or agreements have been finalized, according to the administration.As a whole, Pennsylvania has 37,000 hospital beds, although many are occupied.___JOBLESS CLAIMSPennsylvanians filed another 48,000 unemployment compensation claims on Thursday, according to information from Wolf\\'s administration.That means Pennsylvanians have filed nearly 700,000 claims over the past 12 days as Wolf ordered thousands of \"non-life-sustaining\" businesses to shut down to help stop the spread of the coronavirus.In the seven days through last Saturday, Pennsylvanians filed about 379,000 claims, the most in the nation and smashing the state\\'s record for an entire week.In the four days since then, Pennsylvanians have filed another 319,000, putting the state on course to break last week\\'s record.'"

       "'EMBED >More News Videos Here\\'s how you can prepare for a coronavirus outbreak, via AccuWeather.  EMBED >More News Videos Whether you\\'re traveling for spring break or making summer travel plans, you may be worried about COVID-19 impacting your trip.  HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania (WPVI) -- Officials in Bucks County reported three new positive coronavirus cases, bringing the state total to over 76.Gov. Tom Wolf extended a shutdown order Monday to the entire state of Pennsylvania in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus, although he also maintained that he would not send the National Guard or state police to force businesses to close or stop events.Wolf acted in similar fashion as neighboring states, including Ohio, New York and New Jersey, as he closed schools statewide and a range of government offices in the days leading up to Monday.The shutdown of nonessential government offices and nonessential business activity will begin Tuesday, he said.\"This isn\\'t a decision that I take lightly at all,\" Wolf said during a news conference at the headquarters of the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency. \"It\\'s one that I\\'m making because medical experts believe it\\'s the only way we can prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed by patients.\"Wolf had in recent days issued similar orders for four heavily populated southeastern Pennsylvania counties - Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery - where the state has confirmed most of its cases of COVID-19, while Philadelphia took a similar step Monday.Wolf\\'s order is a blend of voluntary and mandatory actions. For instance, the Pennsylvania Gaming Control Board said it was suspending gambling operations for all casinos. Wolf on Sunday night ordered bars and restaurants in five counties to close dine-in service and said businesses that do not adhere to the order could face penalties.Still, he also said that he would not use force to close businesses, but he urged people to understand that all Pennsylvanians are in the fight together and said they owe it to one another not to spread the disease.\"People will be making their decisions what they do with their lives all across the commonwealth for the next days and weeks and months,\" Wolf said in response to a reporter\\'s question about racetracks refusing to close unless forced. \"What we ought to do is think not what should we do in terms what the law is, but what should we do in terms of what we owe to our fellow citizens.\"Wolf\\'s orders in recent days have often caused confusion and required clarification or adjustments.Meanwhile, Pennsylvania\\'s Supreme Court gave local judges the ability to shut down county courthouses as needed and the Pennsylvania Turnpike interchanges will no longer take cash or credit cards.A look at the other developments in Pennsylvania:___Cases confirmed by the Pennsylvania Department of Health have exceeded 75, as of Monday. The majority of confirmed cases have been in southeastern Pennsylvania.Health officials have said most of the people affected were in isolation at home, with a handful being treated at hospitals.The virus that has stricken tens of thousands around the globe causes only mild symptoms for the majority of the people who become infected but can be deadly for some, especially older adults and people with certain health conditions such as respiratory illness.___The number of medical professionals getting infected with the fast-spreading COVID-19 in Pennsylvania is growing.St. Christopher\\'s Hospital for Children in Philadelphia closed its trauma department and closed its intensive care unit to new admissions after a physician was diagnosed with the illness.The physician, who worked in the intensive care unit last Monday through Wednesday, did not acquire the infection in the hospital, the hospital\\'s acting CEO, Ron Dreskin, said in letter posted on the hospital\\'s website.The case at St. Christopher\\'s follows reports in recent days that a Lehigh Valley Health Network staffer and a Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia cardiologist had met with patients before testing positive.St. Christopher\\'s intensive care unit staff will wear protective equipment, including gowns, gloves, eye protection and masks when they are treating patients. The unit\\'s staff will wear surgical masks when they are outside of patient rooms, the hospital said.Meanwhile, hospital systems are increasingly restricting hospital visits and opening local testing sites.___The Wolf administration\\'s definition of nonessential businesses includes community and recreation centers; gyms, including yoga, barre and spin facilities; hair salons, nail salons and spas; casinos; concert venues; theaters; bars; sporting event venues and golf courses; retail facilities, including shopping malls, except for pharmacies or other health care facilities within retail operations.Restaurants are to remain open for carry-out and delivery orders, and shut down dine-in service.In Philadelphia, Mayor Jim Kenney on Monday ordered a two-week halt to all nonessential business activity and city government operations in the city of 1.6 million people.Kenney asked that residents and businesses observe the restrictions, and said he understood that it could have devastating effects on them.\"We are aware that this will disrupt life in Philadelphia and we do not make these changes lightly,\" Kenney said in an address from City Hall.His administration said essential businesses include grocery stores, banks, gas stations, big box stores, day cares, pharmacies and hardware stores, or stores that sell a range of consumer goods. Restaurants and bars in Philadelphia cannot have dine-in service, but can still offer takeout and delivery options.Wolf on Friday ordered the closure of all schools statewide and a no-visitor policy at all state prisons and licensed nursing homes statewide.He also ordered staff in the Capitol complex in Harrisburg to work from home, if they are able. In Pittsburgh, city officials on Sunday announced a ban on public gatherings of 50 people or more.Wolf also ordered all all Fine Wine & Good Spirits stores and licensee service centers to close effective 9 p.m. on Tuesday, March 17. Sales at www.FineWineAndGoodSpirits.com will cease at 5:00 PM Monday.\"This was a tremendously difficult decision to make, and we understand the disruption our store closures will have on consumers and licensees across the commonwealth,\" said Board Chairman Tim Holden. \"But in these uncertain and unprecedented times, the public health crisis and mitigation effort must take priority over the sale of wine and spirits, as the health and safety of our employees and communities is paramount.\"___The Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission said that cash and credit cards will not be accepted at any interchange statewide beginning Monday at 8 p.m. The measure is designed to keep travelers safe, so that they don\\'t need to stop at tollbooths or interact with tolling personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic, the commission said.All tolls will be assessed electronically via E-ZPass or the turnpike\\'s Toll By Plate program. Travelers are being asked to travel at posted speed limits through tolling points and pay attention when going through interchanges.___The Pennsylvania Supreme Court is giving the chief judges in each county authority to close down court facilities and suspend time limits that normally apply to court proceedings. The high court acted Monday and provided the emergency powers through April 14. The order, however, doesn\\'t affect criminal defendants\\' right to speedy trials.___Members of the Pennsylvania House are coming to Harrisburg for a Monday afternoon voting session, but Democratic leaders say it is unneeded and puts health at risk.Minority Leader Frank Dermody, D-Allegheny, said in a email to fellow lawmakers Sunday night that Republican leaders were insisting on swearing in a newly elected member and voting for COVID-19 legislation that the Wolf administration has said it does not need.Among the possible topics for debate are House rules changes to allow the chamber to conduct business remotely. Dermody said Democrats \"have significant concerns\" with the Republican-drafted proposals.House Speaker Mike Turzai, R-Allegheny, told members that Wolf has requested legislation to be moved, although Wolf said Friday there was nothing his agencies needed.Tuesday and Wednesday voting sessions were possible in the state Senate to address funding, schools and employment issues related to the virus, a Senate GOP spokeswoman said.Meanwhile, three elections to fill vacancies in the House were expected to go forward as scheduled Tuesday.House Republican leaders on Sunday said they based their decision not to postpone the elections in part on the fact that absentee balloting is already underway.All three seats are open because the previous occupants, all Republicans, were elected to other positions last fall. The seats are based in Mercer County, Bucks County and Westmoreland County.___The Associated Press receives support for health and science coverage from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\\'s Department of Science Education.

       "'PHILADELPHIA (CBS/AP) — The number of coronavirus cases in Philadelphia has now topped 1,000 as the statewide total has climbed above 4,000. Pennsylvania health officials reported nearly 700 new cases on Monday, as the total number of cases across the commonwealth now stands at 4,087.  Fifty people have now died from the virus in Pennsylvania.  In Philadelphia, officials revealed over 180 new cases in the city on Monday, bringing the total number to 1,072. The death toll has climbed to nine in the city, after Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley reported a woman in her 80s with an underlying health condition died.  Of those nine deaths, five have been of nursing home residents.  “It’s entirely clear this virus is everywhere in the city,” Philadelphia Health Commissioner Dr. Thomas Farley says.  “The more people that stay home, the less likely this is to spike,” Mayor Jim Kenney said.  Chester County also announced its first COVID-19-related death. Officials say an 89-year-old man who resided in Willistown Township died on Sunday.  He had been hospitalized and had a number of underlying conditions.  “We were heartbroken to learn of this first death in Chester County, and on behalf of the whole community, we offer our deepest condolences to loved ones of this individual,” officials said in a statement.  In Montgomery County, officials announced its sixth coronavirus-related death. The latest death was an 82-year-old woman from Springfield Township who had underlying health conditions. Officials say she was in the hospital at the time of her death.  Coronavirus Update: Latest On COVID-19 Cases, School Closings And Cancellations Across Delaware Valley  Meanwhile, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf revised the stay-at-home orders to include Carbon, Cumberland, Dauphin and Schuylkill counties, bringing the state total to 26 counties under the order.  Schools have also been closed indefinitely.  “Our business and school closures will no longer have a set date to resume normal operations,” Wolf said. “Until now I’ve been saying another two weeks, another two weeks. But now I’m going to leave the date indefinite.”  He went on to say that schools and businesses will remain closed as long as they need to be to keep Pennsylvania safe.  “I know this isn’t easy to hear, we are built to want to work, to learn, to socialize and it’s hard being confined,” Wolf said. “We miss our friends, we miss being with family members but if we want to save lives, we must continue to distance ourselves from each other.”  On Sunday, a formal request was made for a federal major disaster declaration, saying it would provide additional help to governments responding to the crisis.  LATEST CORONAVIRUS STORIES  Wolf signed a disaster emergency proclamation for Pennsylvania on March 6 and it remains in effect.  (© Copyright 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc. All Rights Reserved.

       "\"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP/CBS) — Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf is ordering residents of the state’s hardest-hit areas to stay home to help combat the spread of the coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused several deaths statewide. Wolf issued the stay-at-home order for Philadelphia and its surrounding counties, including Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery Counties; Allegheny County, which includes Pittsburgh; and Monroe County in the Pocono Mountains.  Together, those counties account for 75% of the state’s confirmed cases of COVID-19. The directive will cover 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population.  Today I’m issuing a Stay at Home order for Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Monroe, & Montgomery counties. Starting at 8pm, residents must stay home unless someone’s life depends on leaving. Philadelphia Co. is already under a Stay at Home order, passed by @PhiladelphiaGov. pic.twitter.com/plwrh1VLvi — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) March 23, 2020  The stay-at-home order will last two weeks for these counties and went into effect at 8 p.m. Wolf says he wanted to define the order for the counties that have been hardest hit.  “I’m asking everyone to participate to their fullest extent. I know this is going to be difficult, even more than it is already. These restrictions are unlike anything we’ve experienced before,” Wolf said.  Yellow tape and fencing now block off a community playground in Conshohocken. It’s unclear when children’s laughter will be heard at places like this again.  According to Wolf, this is a disruption that the commonwealth has not experienced since the Civil War.  Wolf also extended school closures in the state for two more weeks, through at least April 6.  I'm also extending school closures and other statewide #COVID19 mitigation efforts for ALL counties for 2 more weeks. These measures may seem extreme. However, we are in desperate times and need to make drastic changes in order to save lives. #COVID19 — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) March 23, 2020  Wolf said residents will be able to leave their homes for “allowable activities,” including trips to the grocery store and the pharmacy. He did not say how it would be enforced.  Takeout eateries are also allowed to stay open but the governor asks that you think before you go.  “Do I really need to make this trip or am I going to put someone else’s life in jeopardy by making this trip?” Wolf said.  Outdoor exercise is also permitted if social distancing is obeyed.  Wolf said the administration wanted to take a “measured approach” to the crisis and expressed hope that if the coronavirus could be largely contained to the most heavily impacted counties, he could avoid extending his stay-at-home order to the entire state.  “The novel coronavirus has halted life as we knew it,” Wolf said. “I won’t pretend that things will not get worse before they get better.”  Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney had already instituted a stay-at-home order for residents.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele spoke about enforcing the upgraded order for businesses who should but have not closed yet.  “There may be some businesses that are deemed not life-sustaining businesses under the order that might consider staying open,” Steele said. “My advice to you is don’t do it.”  The stay-at-home order comes as the number of coronavirus cases in Pennsylvania rose to 698. Six people have died from the virus in the state.  Wolf has imposed a series of progressively tougher measures in the face of a global pandemic that state officials say threatens to swamp hospitals and spike the death toll. The governor has already closed schools and ordered all “non-life-sustaining” businesses to shutter their physical locations, an edict that state police and other government agencies began enforcing Monday morning after Wolf beat back a pair of legal challenges.  ___  COURT DISMISSES LAWSUIT ON NONESSENTIAL BUSINESSES  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit filed by a gun shop that challenged Wolf’s authority to shutter businesses deemed nonessential.  Without comment, a narrow majority of the state’s high court late Sunday denied the petition by a gun shop, a gun purchaser and a law firm to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The lawsuit had claimed Wolf’s edict violated the Second Amendment right to bear arms and other constitutional rights.  The court said a separate legal challenge to Wolf’s order to close law offices had become moot because of subsequent action that lets lawyers work from their physical locations to perform duties deemed essential by county or federal judges.  The Democratic governor has ordered all nonessential businesses to close their physical locations indefinitely, saying the measure is needed to help slow the spread of the new coronavirus and prevent hospitals from becoming overwhelmed with COVID-19 patients.  In a dissenting statement joined by two other justices, Justice David Wecht said Wolf’s order amounts to “an absolute and indefinite prohibition upon the acquisition of firearms by the citizens of this commonwealth — a result in clear tension with the Second Amendment” and the state constitution. He called on Wolf to make some allowance for the in-person sale of firearms.  ___  ENFORCEMENT BEGINS  Wolf’s order to close down the physical locations of businesses deemed not essential to sustain life is being enforced as of Monday morning.  The Wolf administration has been sorting through nearly 10,000 waiver requests, saying their only consideration is health and safety.  State police spokesman Ryan Tarkowski said Monday that troopers are aiming at voluntary compliance, “not coming in with a hammer at 8:01” a.m., when the enforcement period began.  “Our goal is not to write a giant pile of citations,” he said.  Tarkowski said people who want to report a business that remains open should use non-emergency numbers to call state police or local police. “Please don’t call 911,” Tarkowski said.  ___  WHAT’S OPEN, CLOSED  Businesses that remain open to the public include grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and motels, beer distributors, laundromats and gas stations. Restaurants are only open for take-out orders. The open list also includes farms, mines, food production and some manufacturing.  Car dealers, clothing stores and other retailers, salons and entertainment venues are among those on the shuttered list.  On Monday, Pennsylvania officials extended the closure of facilities in state parks and forests until April 30. People with reservations for campgrounds, cabins and other overnight accommodations will get refunds.  The Department of Conservation and Natural Resources said trails, lakes, forests, roads and parking areas remain open to the public, but urged people to practice social distancing and avoid crowded parking lots and trailheads.  The closure includes restrooms.  ___  CASES  Pennsylvania health officials on Monday reported 165 new cases of COVID-19 infection in Pennsylvania, for a total of more than 690 in 34 counties.  Lackawanna County Coroner Tim Rowland confirmed the death of a 79-year-old man late Sunday, bringing the state’s overall death toll to six.  For most people, the virus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia. The vast majority of people recover.  ___  STATE HOUSE  The state House of Representatives began a non-voting session Monday, and the speaker assigned proposals to get emergency assistance for small businesses and to allow for electronic notarization of documents to committees. The State Government Committee planned to meet to consider legislation regarding the April 28 primary, which could be delayed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

The confirmed cases largely have been traced back to contact with the new coronavirus in another state or country. Most people are at home in isolation, officials say; a few are hospitalized.  For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.  The vast majority of people recover.

The school shutdown order affects more than 1.7 million school children, in public and private K-12 schools.  When it is determined that students can return to school, administrators, teachers and other staff will be given two days to prepare classrooms, set up cafeterias, schedule transportation and arrange other business operations. Students would return on the third day.  PHILADELPHIA  Philadelphia officials are issuing a stay-at-home order and banning public gatherings beginning 8 a.m. Monday in an effort to slow the spread of the novel coronavirus.  The city is using a special system to share important information about COVID-19 through free text alerts. You can text the keyword COVIDPHL to 888-777 to receive info and updates through ReadyPhiladelphia, the city\\'s mass communication system.  The Philadelphia Department of Public Health on Saturday announced the activation of the Greater Philadelphia Coronavirus Helpline at 1-800-722-7112. The 24/7 helpline is a free resource to anyone in the Greater Philadelphia area who has questions about COVID-19.  MEAL SERVICE  Philadelphia officials are providing meal service for students while schools remain closed.  For more information, including available pick-up sites, see here.  Shelves in Montgomery County are empty as customers stock up on cleaning supplies.  STAY-AT-HOME ORDER  Gov. Tom Wolf on Monday ordered residents of Pennsylvania’s hardest-hit areas to stay home for at least two weeks to help combat the spread of the new coronavirus that has already sickened hundreds and caused six deaths statewide.  Wolf implored residents to take heed of his order to stay at home.  “You need to ask yourself, do I really need to make this trip? Or am I going to put someone else’s life in jeopardy by making this trip? Am I going to be saving a life by staying home?” Wolf said.  The order took effect at 8 p.m. Monday.  In all, 5.5 million people, or more than 40% of the state’s population, have been ordered to stay home. Wolf said residents will be able to leave their homes for “allowable activities.”  (Pexels)  LEGAL ACTIONS  Several more businesses have filed a legal challenge to Wolf’s order closing the physical locations of businesses determined to be “non-life-sustaining.”  A petition filed in Commonwealth Court seeks to have Wolf’s shutdown order thrown out. The plaintiffs are a law firm, a laundromat, a timber company and a golf course, all of which appeared on the governor’s initial list of businesses that were to shut down as of Thursday night.  The Wolf administration has since revised the list, relaxing its blanket closure of law offices and placing laundromats and timber companies on the “life sustaining” list, allowing them to stay open.  But the lawsuit said Wolf “quite simply made up these categories and their terminology out of whole cloth,” and alleges his shutdown order and subsequent revisions “caused mass confusion and disturbance throughout Pennsylvania.”  Wolf has already beat back two other legal challenges to his authority to order businesses to close.  Separately, the American Civil Liberties Union of Pennsylvania and other lawyers filed a federal lawsuit Tuesday seeking the release of 13 people from civil detention as they await resolution of their immigration cases. The lawsuit says the detainees are older or suffer from medical conditions that put them at greater risk of COVID-19. The detainees are currently being held in the Clinton, Pike and York county jails.  (Reading Terminal Market)  WHAT\\'S OPEN AND CLOSED  Businesses that remain open to the public include grocery stores, pharmacies, hotels and motels, beer distributors, laundromats and gas stations. Restaurants are only open for take-out orders. The open list also includes farms, mines, food production and some manufacturing.  Car dealers, clothing stores and other retailers, salons and entertainment venues are among those on the shuttered list.  Meanwhile, motorists of all types, not just truck drivers, are getting access to indoor facilities at 23 interstate rest stops across Pennsylvania.  The state Transportation Department on Tuesday said it was reopening the indoor bathrooms and would keep them cleaned and maintained.  The agency had previously reopened a smaller number of stops, with portable restrooms, and made them available to truck drivers. The reopened indoor bathrooms are on interstates 79, 80, 81 and 84.  SHUTDOWN ENFORCEMENT  On Monday, the first day of enforcement, Pennsylvania State Police troopers issued 27 warnings, but no citations, based on Wolf\\'s directive that businesses deemed not life-sustaining close their physical locations.  The overwhelming majority of people and businesses were complying voluntarily with the order, the state police commissioner, Col. Robert Evanchick, said Tuesday.  Other forms of enforcement will follow the warnings, if needed, he said.

The House and Senate could both pass the bill Wednesday. Wolf will sign it if it reaches his desk, his office said.  The Republican-sponsored amendment would also let counties consolidate polling places, in part because some are currently located within long-term care facilities and because many poll workers are older people who are particularly at risk from COVID-19.  Primary voters will choose candidates for the presidential race, congressional seats, both chambers of the Legislature and the row offices.  The House employed special remote voting procedures adopted as a result of the pandemic, and one leader, Minority Whip Jordan Harris, D-Philadelphia, wore rubber gloves and used a mask to protect himself.  (Photo by EVA HAMBACH/AFP via Getty Images)  SUPPLIES TIGHT  With hospitals warning they could run out of masks and other protective gear in about three weeks as COVID-19 spikes, Wolf\\'s administration said it is rushing to procure more medical supplies from the federal government\\'s stockpile, from other states and countries, and from manufacturers repurposing their factories.  \"There’s a full-on effort across the administration to make sure we have the supplies for our healthcare personnel to deal with the surge of patients from COVID-19,” Health Secretary Rachel Levine said Tuesday.  Officials have been vague about the state\\'s readiness, however.  Levine has steadfastly refused to say how much protective gear Pennsylvania has in its possession, and how much it still needs to help healthcare workers safely treat the anticipated surge of coronavirus patients. Nor have officials answered questions about the state\\'s supply of respirators, or how many more hospital beds it might need to meet demand.  Carter, of the hospital association, said hospitals are scrambling to obtain enough protective gear to meet demand. Some facilities could run out of masks and other equipment in a matter of days or even hours as they become flooded with COVID-19 patients, he said. Overall, hospitals across the state have about a three-week supply, he said.  ___  For the latest local news, sports and weather, download the FOX 29 News app.  DOWNLOAD: FOX 29 NEWS APP  ___  The Associated Press contributed to this report.'"

       "'With 276 positive cases of the new coronavirus reported Wednesday afternoon, Pennsylvania\\'s statewide total soared passed 1,000 and the death toll rose to 11.  The rising number of patients both in the state and nationwide are partly a result of increased testing. As of Wednesday, 11,193 patients tested negative for the virus in Pennsylvania, a one-day increase of about 2,500.  Gov. Tom Wolf\\'s stay-at-home order was increased to include two more counties. The revised order includes: Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware, Erie, Lehigh, Monroe, Montgomery, Northampton, and Philadelphia counties.  The amended order goes into effect at 8 p.m. and will remain until April 6.  As the White House and Senate agreed to a stimulus package Wednesday, state legislators in Pennsylvania voted to delay the primary because of the coronavirus pandemic.  After five days of negotiations, the White House and the Senate agreed on a $2 trillion stimulus package early Wednesday for most Americans.  The economic relief bill will give direct payments to most Americans, expand unemployment benefits and provide a $367 billion program for small businesses to keep making payroll while workers are forced to stay home.  Confirmed cases in America, now over 55,200, have been climbing at an exponential rate — especially in New York — and more are expected as the U.S. increases testing. Globally, almost 19,000 people have been killed by the virus according to the Johns Hopkins University data dashboard.  More:Ventilators are the biggest coronavirus concern in Pennsylvania right now  The measure to delay the primary by five weeks, potentially past the spike of the state\\'s spreading coronavirus cases, passed the state House and Senate on Wednesday.

More:Pennsylvania primary postponed until June because of the coronavirus  In addition to delaying the primary date, the legislation would give county election offices a head start on processing and tabulating mail-in ballots, and let counties consolidate polling places.

       "'Pennsylvania health officials say 83 new cases of coronavirus have been reported, bringing the statewide total to 268.  The state Department of Health released new numbers Friday and it’s the largest one-day increase to date. On Thursday, the state reported 52 new cases being confirmed. For perspective, last Friday there were only 41 cases confirmed in the state.  There are 2,574 patients who have tested negative, the department said. Since most testing is now being done in commercial or hospital laboratories, the state no longer provides numbers on the pending cases awaiting confirmation.  Most of the cases have been reported in the Philadelphia region but the virus continues to spread statewide. State officials have confirmed cases in 26 of Pennsylvania’s 67 counties.  Confirmed cases have been found in central Pennsylvania, including in Cumberland, Lancaster, Lebanon and York counties, state officials said. York County reported 4 new cases, bringing the county’s total to 6. Franklin County and Centre County both have their first confirmed cases, the department said Friday.  More cases are being reported in western Pennsylvania as well, with Allegheny County now reporting 28 cases. The health department said Friday a case has been reported in Erie County for the first time.  Carmine Fusco, a 55-year-old horse trainer in Northampton County, died Wednesday, becoming the state’s first fatality in the pandemic; his mother and two siblings in New Jersey have also died due to the virus. Earlier this week, Gov. Tom Wolf said Fusco’s death “is just the first death of what will become many.”  The governor has been taking increasingly aggressive steps to stem the spread of the coronavirus.  Yesterday, Wolf ordered all non-life-sustaining businesses in Pennsylvania to close their physical locations to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Using his authority under an emergency declaration, Wolf intends to begin enforcing this order starting at 12:01 a.m. Saturday.  Some business trade groups say companies need more clarity about who can stay open and who must close. Republican legislative leaders have asked the governor to provide a clearer explanation on how he took the step. Republican U.S. Rep. Fred Keller, whose district includes a large swath of central Pennsylvania, issued a statement Friday calling for Wolf to rescind the order on businesses.  Wolf previously ordered schools to close this week and next week. Penn State University and other colleges have shifted to online instruction for the remainder of the semester.  Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania’s health secretary, continues to stress to the public the urgent need to stay home to limit the spread of the disease. Bluntly, Levine and Wolf have said staying home saves lives.  “Pennsylvanians have a very important job right now: stay calm, stay home and stay safe,\" Levine said.

       "'Updated 2:21 p.m.  Pennsylvania has confirmed its first two cases of the new coronavirus, one in Delaware County and one in Wayne County, and health officials hoped to track down people who had contact with them, Gov. Tom Wolf and state officials said Friday.  More positive tests for the virus, which causes the disease COVID-19, are expected in the coming days and weeks, state officials said.  Following the announcement of the first two presumptive positive cases of coronavirus, known as COVID-19, @GovernorTomWolf today signed an emergency disaster declaration to increase support to state agencies involved in the response to the virus.https://t.co/n0DYjvBKTa — Office of the Governor (@GovernorsOffice) March 6, 2020  The first two positive tests came back early Friday, and the two people are isolated in their homes, Wolf told a news conference at Pennsylvania Emergency Management Headquarters in Harrisburg. Afterward, the governor signed an emergency disaster declaration to grant state agencies more freedom to use resources to respond to the virus, the administration said.  Details that would reveal the identities of the infected people are not being released, officials said, and they are not disclosing how many tests for the virus have been run at a state lab.  Wolf urged people to remain calm, and said his Department of Health is staffed with highly trained medical and public health personnel who, along with the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency, are coordinating with every level of government.  One of the confirmed cases is an adult who recently had exposure to an infected person in another state, and Pennsylvania health officials became aware of it right away, according to Dr. Sharon Watkins, the director for the state’s Bureau of Epidemiology. That person, a woman, is in Delaware County, officials there said.  Today we have our first two confirmed cases of Coronavirus in Pennsylvania. I want to assure Pennsylvanians that we are prepared for this. This is not the first rapidly spreading virus we have faced, and it certainly will not be our last. #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/3diAywJIwE — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) March 6, 2020  The other confirmed case, in Wayne County, is an adult who recently traveled extensively in Europe, including to countries where the new virus is widespread, Watkins said.  Their exposure to others in Pennsylvania is being investigated, but health officials believe, for now, that it is relatively limited, Watkins said.  Officials worked Friday to locate people who had close contact with the two infected people and will ask them to quarantine themselves for 14 days, Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine said.  Officials otherwise gave the same advice that they have been giving for weeks: People should wash their hands regularly, be prudent in crowds, cover their mouths when coughing or sneezing, clean surfaces frequently, stay home if they feel sick and call a health care provider if they fear they have COVID-19.  Separately, classes were canceled Friday at five schools in a Bucks County school district because some members of its community were exposed to a confirmed case of the virus, district officials said.  The school district’s action is unrelated to the two cases confirmed in Pennsylvania, and there was no confirmed case of the new coronavirus in Bucks County, health officials said.  The decision to close the schools was made “out of an abundance of caution” after consultations with state and local health officials, Central Bucks Superintendent John Kopicki said.  The schools will be deep cleaned.  The U.S. death toll from COVID-19 climbed to 14, with all but one victim in Washington state, while the number of infections increased to over 200 across 18 states.  The virus has infected around 100,000 people worldwide and killed over 3,400, the vast majority of them in China. Most cases have been mild, and more than half of those infected have recovered.'"

Tom Wolf extended a shutdown order to the entire state of Pennsylvania in an effort to halt the spread of the coronavirus as the number of cases rose to 76 on Monday, including a 2-year-old Montgomery County girl. Wolf had already called for nonessential government offices to close and nonessential business activity to end in four heavily populated southeastern Pennsylvania counties.  On Monday, he extended that order to the rest of the state.  “This isn’t a decision that I take lightly at all,” Wolf said. “It’s one I’m making because medical experts believe it’s the only way we can prevent our hospitals from being overwhelmed.”  Health officials announced 13 additional positive COVID-19 cases in Pennsylvania as the number of cases continues to rise in Philadelphia and the surrounding suburbs.  The patients are either in isolation at home or being treated at the hospital.  “While we anticipate that there will be more Pennsylvanians with COVID-19 in the coming days and weeks, it is important for residents to know the commonwealth is prepared and to be prepared themselves,” Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Levine said. “Right now, you have a higher chance of testing positive for COVID-19 if you have traveled to a country or state with known community outbreaks or have come in contact with someone who has the virus. We are working with the health care community across Pennsylvania to keep them informed, consult on patient testing and ensuring they have the resources they need to care for patients.”  Officials announced one additional confirmed case in Philadelphia, bringing the city total to nine.

I want to assure Pennsylvanians that we are prepared for this. This is not the first rapidly spreading virus we have faced, and it certainly will not be our last. #COVID19 pic.twitter.com/3diAywJIwE — Governor Tom Wolf (@GovernorTomWolf) March 6, 2020  “We anticipated this very scenario and have been preparing for Pennsylvanians to become impacted by this virus,” Governor Wolf said. “This is not the first rapidly-spreading virus we have faced in our commonwealth and it will not be the last. We are prepared to mitigate the spread of this virus.”  The two people are quarantined in their homes, Wolf said.  One of the individuals is an adult from Wayne County who traveled to a country where the virus was present.  The other is an adult from Delaware County that recently traveled to an area of the U.S. where the virus was present.  Highmark has announced that they will cover the cost of coronavirus testing. In a statement, Highmark says:  With COVID-19 (or the coronavirus) commanding the news, Highmark understands that this issue is of great concern for our health plan members. In an effort to address the spread of the coronavirus and bring peace of mind to our members, Highmark will cover coronavirus testing, when recommended by a medical professional, for members of our fully-insured group customers, as well as members of our Medicare Advantage and ACA plans.  No other information on the people affected has been released. Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine says the cases are not related to a case that closed schools in Bucks County.  “Further spread of this virus throughout the nation will likely occur,” Dr. Levine said. “We encourage people to prepare for potential life disruptions. The same family emergency plans and kits that we use to prepare for flu or norovirus, and even snowstorms and floods, are important now. Pennsylvanians should continue to help stop the spread of viruses by washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, cleaning surfaces and staying home if you are sick.”  Classes were canceled Friday at five schools because some members of its school community were exposed to a separate confirmed case of COVID-19.  To date, there are nearly 100,000 cases worldwide and over 3,000 deaths. This includes 233 cases and 12 deaths in the U.S.  The CDC is expecting cases to be confirmed in the coming weeks.  They are urging individuals planning to travel outside of the country to check the CDC’s travel guidance before leaving the country.  Symptoms of COVID-19 can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Those symptoms may appear anywhere between two days and 14 days after exposure. Individuals at most risk are the elderly and those with pre-existing conditions.  Health officials are reminding individuals that may not feel well to take the following steps:  Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds.  If soap and water are not available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer  Cover coughs and sneezes with elbow, not hands  Clean surfaces frequently, such as countertops, light switches, cell phones and other frequently touched areas  Contain – if someone is not feeling well or is sick, stay home until they are better.  “As this situation evolves, we will continually update Pennsylvanians through our website, health.pa.gov, our Facebook page and our Twitter account,” Dr. Levine said. “It’s important to remember that the most accurate and timely information regarding this outbreak is available through the Department of Health.”  According to the Pennsylvania Department of Health, they can currently perform 125 tests per day at its state lab but they are bringing commercial labs on board, upping the ability to do 125-150 tests per day by the weekend.

       "'UPDATE: Pennsylvania cases now total 41; 2nd county asked to go on lockdown  CORRECTION: The first pediatric case of the new coronavirus in Pennsylvania is in Monroe County, not Montgomery County. The post and map have been updated to reflect this.  UPDATE (12:55 p.m.): Friday’s total was originally reported as 28 after a moring new release. During its daily briefing, the Pennsylvania Department of Health confirmed a total of 33 presumptive cases of the new coronavirus. The headline, post and map have all been updated to reflect this new information.  Pennsylvania’s count of presumptive coronavirus cases jumped by 11 since Thursday, bringing the total of both presumptive and confirmed cases to 33, the state health department announced Friday.  All new cases were reported south of the Lehigh Valley, in counties where the new coronavirus was already known.  Six new cases were announced in a news release at 11:30 a.m.; five more, including the state’s first pediatric case, were announced an hour later at the department’s daily media briefing.  The first child in Pennsylvania to be sickened by the new coronavirus was reported in Monroe County. It is the Poconos county’s third reported case.  Four new presumptive cases are in Montgomery County, which now has 17 and is on state-ordered lockdown. Four more are in Delaware County, which now has five, and two were identified in Philadelphia, bringing the total there to three. Aside from the new Monroe County case, all others so far reported in the state are adults who are either being cared for at a hospital or in isolation at home.  The federal Centers for Disease Control also confirmed results from six more state tests. The CDC had to this point only confirmed two Pennsylvania tests as results mount. The confirmations affirm the virus that causes COVID-19 is present in four Montgomery County cases and one case each in Delaware and Wayne counties.  The CDC has not yet confirmed a coronavirus case in Northampton County, the only one known so far in the Lehigh Valley.  The Pennsylvania health department says that of the 278 people who have been tested, 138 were negative. However, there are still 112 tests pending results.  These are the main symptoms of COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.CDC  Anyone who has symptoms of COVID-19 – fever, cough and shortness of breath – should contact their health care provider or call ahead to a local emergency room, Pennsylvania Health Secretary Rachel Levine said. Doctors can order tests either through the health department or through private labs that now offer them.  Barring that, anyone with symptoms can also call the state health department at 1-877-PA-HEALTH (1-877-724-3258).  “If you do not have any symptoms, you do not need to be tested at this time. If you have mild symptoms ... that could be a cold, that could be allergies, you do not need to be tested at this time,\" Levine said in Friday’s media briefing.  MORE: How to get tested for coronavirus in the Lehigh Valley  The World Health Organization reports that the coronavirus has infected more than 127,000 people and killed 4,700.

       "'What to Know Two people have tested positive for the new coronavirus in the Philadelphia suburbs, health officials said Friday. The patients are from Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Camden County, New Jersey.  Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a disaster declaration for the state to allow for a quicker response to prevent the spread of the virus.  A second Pennsylvanian from Wayne County has also tested positive for COVID-19, state officials said.  UPDATE: On Saturday, Gov. Wolf announced two new COVID-19 cases in Montgomery County, bringing the total to four in Pennsylvania. New details HERE.  The Philadelphia region recorded its first two cases of the new coronavirus on Friday with patients testing positive for the virus in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, and Camden County, New Jersey.  Both people are considered presumptive positive for COVID-19, which means local testing came back positive, but that the results must be confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Samples have been sent to the federal lab.  The Camden County, New Jersey, patient is a 61-year-old man from Cherry Hill. He is currently hospitalized in stable condition at Jefferson Cherry Hill hospital. Officials are checking on those who were in contact with him, including healthcare workers and an EMS transport.  “While we know that any case of coronavirus presents a cause for concern for our residents, we want to emphasize that this case only reemphasizes the need to follow personal hygiene guidelines vigilantly, this should not be a cause for panic and the risk to the general public remains low,” Camden County health officer Paschal Nwako said.  The Camden County man is one of four New Jersey residents who contracted the virus.  In Delaware County, Pennsylvania, a woman is currently under self-quarantine at home after traveling to an area in the United States where coronavirus is present, Delaware County Council member Monica Taylor said during a news conference on Friday.  A woman is currently under self-quarantine at home after traveling to an area in the United States where COVID-19 is present. NBC10’s Investigative reporter Mitch Blacher was live in Media, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, to show you how the county is taking action to prevent the virus from spreading.  Dr. Rachel Levine, Pennsylvania\\'s health secretary, said state health officials are tracking down every person the woman was in close contact with recently. They will be put under a 14-day self-quarantine, the time-frame recommended by the CDC.  “They’re aggressively chasing down where this person was, who they had contact with and reaching out to them,\" Delaware County Emergency Services Department Head Timothy Boyce said of the state\\'s efforts. \"Our role is to prevent panic. There’s no need for that, but there is certainly a heightened sense of urgency here in Delaware County now that we do have a presumed case.\"  Taylor added that county officials have been working with state agencies and the CDC to contain any outbreak. She said cleaning will increase in highly trafficked areas and first responders will be issued face masks if responding to calls where people might have the virus.  The new strain of coronavirus originated in Wuhan, China and spread outwardly. Globally, more than 101,000 people had been infected, according to a Johns Hopkins University dashboard of cases, which aggregates various public health sources. In the United States, 240 confirmed cases have been reported, with 14 deaths.  Symptoms of the coronavirus include fever, cough, muscle pain or fatigue and shortness of breath, according to the CDC. The virus has an incubation period – the time between exposure and the first appearance of symptoms – of about five days.  COVID-19 is spread mainly from person-to-person when droplets from an infected person who coughs or sneezes land on someone else’s nose or mouth or enter their lungs, according to the CDC. It can also be spread when someone touches their own mouth, nose and possibly eyes after coming into contact with a surface that has the virus on it.  To prevent the spread of the virus, the CDC recommends frequently washing hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds – or using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol – wiping down dirty surfaces and using the inside of the elbow to cover a cough or sneeze.  Those with the highest risk of contracting the disease are older people with underlying chronic medical conditions like heart, lung or kidney disease, according to the CDC.  Delaware County Senior Medical Advisor Dr. George Avetian added that only essential visits are being allowed at the county nursing home, due to older people’s higher risk of contracting the virus.  Delaware County Council member Monica Taylor said the person infected with the new coronavirus in the county is a woman who had traveled out of state. “This individual had recently traveled to an area in the United States where COVID-19 is present,” she said.  The woman from Delaware County is one of two Pennsylvania residents who contracted the virus. A resident of Wayne County, which is near Scranton in northeastern Pennsylvania, also tested positive.  Levine, the state health secretary, emphasized that the cases were not community spread, which is when someone becomes ill in a certain area and has “no travel history, no known exposure and we have no idea how they got it.”  Levine said both Pennsylvania patients are adults in \"good physical condition.\"  The Wayne County resident traveled “extensively” in Europe, including in places for which the CDC issued a Level 3 travel advisory, Levine said. The only European country thus far designated as Level 3 – meaning where nonessential travel is discouraged – is Italy. The other countries are China, Iran and South Korea.  While they\\'re under quarantine, state health officials will be contacting the patients daily by phone to monitor their health. Levine said breaking quarantine will be unlawful.  “They are not to be going to work, or to school, or to go out in public or to use public conveyances,” state health department epidemiologist Dr. Sharon Watkins said.  Levine warned that the number of confirmed cases is expected to rise.  “We expect more cases to be confirmed in the upcoming days and weeks, and we want everyone to take action to help prevent the spread of this novel coronavirus, COVID-19,” she said.  If you start showing symptoms of the flu or what you think might be the coronavirus it is important to stay home. NBC10\\'s Pamela Osborne reports on common signs and how to prepare to avoid the spreading.  Following the announcement of the two presumed cases, Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf issued a disaster declaration for the state. Such a disaster declaration does not release additional funding, but Wolf said it would give officials “the ability to work across agencies” as they combat the outbreak.  “Right now, the emphasis of the plan is mitigation tactics to keep this virus from spreading widely,” Wolf said.  Earlier this week, Pennsylvania began testing for coronavirus at its public health laboratory in Exton. The state currently has the ability to test 20-25 samples a day, but that is expected to dramatically jump to 120-150 daily tests by the weekend, Levine said.  Commercial tests will also soon be available, which will help with detecting possible cases, she said, adding that the state will work with insurance companies to cover the cost for tests.  “We’re going to work to make sure that no one is denied a test that is medically necessary for COVID-19 because of the cost,” she said.  Philadelphia officials say they expect cases of coronavirus to crop up in the city but assure residents that they are prepared to contain the virus.  Attorney General Josh Shapiro warned businesses not to price gouge goods that residents may seek out to prevent contracting the coronavirus. His office set up and email address — pricegouging@attorneygeneral.gov — for residents to report potential instances of businesses charging more than 20% for goods that were previously a cheaper price in the past week.  On Friday, President Donald Trump signed an $8.3 billion measure to help tackle the outbreak of the coronavirus in the U.S. after the legislation passed overwhelmingly in both the House and the Senate. The measure will release funds to federal health agencies.  The announcement of positive cases came as five schools in the Central Bucks School District were closed Friday after students and staff were exposed to someone from out-of-state who later was confirmed to have coronavirus. Levine said those cases are not related to the ones in Delaware or Wayne counties.'"

       "'Pennsylvania officials announced the state\\'s first \"presumed positive\" cases of the new coronavirus on March 6, and more cases have been confirmed since then.  As of March 18, a total of 133 cases have been reported throughout the state, according to the Pennsylvania Department of Health. One person has died.  The state calls the tests \"presumptive positive\" until they are confirmed by the CDC. State Health Secretary Rachel Levine said she was not aware of any tests performed at the state level that were later found by the CDC to be incorrect.  Testing coronavirus:Pennsylvania gets approval to begin COVID-19 testing in state lab immediately  Here\\'s what we know about the coronavirus and cases in Pennsylvania.  First death reported in Pa.  A person has died from COVID-19, according to state authorities.  The patient, an adult from Northampton County, was being treated at a hospital. No other information on them has been released due to confidentiality laws.  Gov. Tom Wolf orders restaurants in five counties to close for dine-in  In the latest move to try to slow the spread of the coronavirus impacting life in Pennsylvania, Gov. Tom Wolf ordered all bars and restaurants in Allegheny, Bucks, Chester, Delaware and Montgomery counties to close for in-person dining beginning Monday, March 16 and lasting for at least two weeks.  Businesses that offer carry-out, delivery, and drive-through food and beverage service may continue to do so, but eating and drinking inside restaurants and bars is temporarily prohibited. Businesses that do not adhere to this order could face enforcement actions.  \"Ensuring the health and safety of Pennsylvanians is the highest priority as the state grapples with a growing number of confirmed cases of COVID-19, and as the virus continues to spread, it is in the best interest of the public to encourage social distancing by closing restaurants and bars temporarily,\" Wolf said. \"I understand that this is disruptive to businesses as well as patrons who just want to enjoy themselves, but in the best interest of individuals and families in the mitigation counties, we must take this step.\"  Pa. school district closes for at least one day  KYW Newsradio reported Monday afternoon that Lower Merion School District will be closed on Tuesday, March 10 after two students and a staff member might have been exposed to COVID-19.  The three people were visiting Children\\'s Hospital of Philadelphia facility in King of Prussia where a cardiologist was later found to have the virus. The cardiologist is in critical condition at Hospital of the University of Penn.  Map:Tracking the coronavirus: Active cases, deaths, recoveries  Where else has the coronavirus spread?  As of March 16, the U.S. death toll rose to 69, with more than 3,770 confirmed cases as of Monday morning. The global death surged past 6,500.  Tracking the coronavirus contagion:Map of existing cases worldwide  School closures, event cancellations  On Friday, March 13, Gov. Tom Wolf announced that all K-12 schools will be closed for 10 business days to help prevent the spread of the coronavirus.  \"Be aware that no school district will be penalized if it fails to meet the 180 day or school hours requirements,\" the release states.  Read More:Gov. Tom Wolf orders all Pa. K-12 schools closed for 10 days due to coronavirus  How some institutions are preparing for the possible spread of coronavirus  Many colleges and university, including Penn State, have limited or cancelled school-sponsored international travel out of concern for the coronavirus. In some cases, students already studying abroad are being brought home.  Many schools are following the CDC travel guidance in regard to planned trips abroad.  They are also looking at the possibility of virtual classes and cancelling large events, depending on the spread of the coronavirus. Princeton University in New Jersey has decided to go to all online courses after spring break, for example.  More:Here\\'s how Penn State University is preparing for the coronavirus  People are seeing changes at church, too, including not offering communion wine and not shaking hands during the sign of peace at Catholic Mass.  What are the symptoms of coronavirus, and is there a cure?  There is currently neither a vaccine nor an approved treatment for the new, or novel coronavirus.  Symptoms of coronavirus can resemble the flu, including fever, cough and shortness of breath. The symptoms range from mild to severe.  Symptoms appear two to 14 days after exposure, according to the CDC.  While younger people may experience the illness as a bad cold with a fever, the concern is that older people and those who have additional medical conditions will develop a more severe form of COVID-19. As the disease spreads widely in the population, that could lead to a high number of patients requiring hospitalization for pneumonia or acute lung problems that require the use of a ventilator to breathe, as well as death.  Data from China show that about 15 percent of people who contract the coronavirus infection develop more severe illness, requiring hospitalization.  If you develop symptoms or have been in contact with someone known to have coronavirus, contact your healthcare professional.  Coronavirus worldwide: By the numbers  Coronavirus has touched at least 120 countries.  Confirmed cases outside of the U.S. include China, Iran, Italy, South Korea, Japan, Hong Kong, France, Australia, Taiwan, Thailand, the Philippines, and on a cruise ship, according to Johns Hopkins.  Here\\'s a breakdown of worldwide numbers, as of Saturday, March 14:  More than 156,000 cases  cases More than 72,600 people have recovered  people have recovered At least 3,280 people have died in more than 40 countries  What does COVID-19 stand for?

       "'HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania -- All schools in Pennsylvania will close for two weeks, Gov. Tom Wolf announced Friday as the state undertook sweeping measures aimed at slowing the spread of the new coronavirus.Wolf on Friday also announced he was extending a day-old shutdown order affecting Montgomery County to encompass Delaware County, another heavily populated Philadelphia suburb the governor said has exhibited \"confirmed evidence of risk.\" Wolf initially announced the Delaware County order would take effect Monday, but an aide subsequently corrected that it will begin Saturday.The school shutdown order affecting more than 1.7 million school children, in public and private K-12 schools. There are now 45 confirmed cases in the state Wolf, who also has discouraged large gatherings of people statewide and canceled prison visits, said his actions are designed to save lives. He urged people to stay calm and stay home.\"My hope is that we\\'ve taken actions that are both decisive and absolutely appropriate,\" Wolf said at a news conference Friday afternoon at the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency headquarters in Harrisburg. \"I know that some of you are worried, but we believe that, by asking everyone to cooperate and spend a few days limiting their interactions with other people, we can help control the spread of this virus in Pennsylvania.\"Wolf said schools will not be penalized if they are unable to reach the 180 days of instruction required under state law. His administration, he said, would evaluate the decision at the end of the 10 days and decide whether to extend it.Governors in several other states, including Maryland and Ohio, had already ordered their schools to close.Following the order, teachers\\' unions, the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and other school organizations released a joint statement in support of the move.Some school officials in Pennsylvania, including in Philadelphia, had warned that children who depend on free or reduced-price meals in school might go hungry. Philadelphia officials had sought to keep their schools open, saying many children have just a single parent who might not be able to work if the child is home.Wolf, however, said the state had received a waiver from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to allow eligible schools to serve meals to students in a \"non-congregate setting,\" such as a drive-through or a grab-and-go.Mark DiRocco, executive director of the Pennsylvania Association of School Administrators, said superintendents are likely staying late Friday to try to answer numerous questions, such as how they will feed children and whether they can do online instruction in the next two weeks.Most, however, are in favor of the move, he said.\"There are so many unknowns about this virus and the last thing a superintendent and board want to deal with is a sudden outbreak among kids in a building, and that will fly through a community so fast,\" DiRocco said.The move came a day after Wolf ordered all schools, day cares and other facilities closed in hard-hit Montgomery County, in the Philadelphia suburbs and home to more than 800,000 people, and asked residents to avoid all non-essential travel. An identical order will take effect Saturday in Delaware County, home to more than 560,000 residents.Already, more than a dozen colleges and universities in Pennsylvania, including Penn State, have shifted to online instruction and are sending students home, while counties have declared emergencies and advised people against attending large gatherings. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto on Friday also declared a state of emergency.Before Wolf acted on Friday, a wave of school closings across Pennsylvania had been growing as the day wore on, with some school officials grumbling that Wolf\\'s administration had not offered more guidance.A look at the latest developments in Pennsylvania:___CASESMost of the state\\'s 41 cases of positive tests are in eastern Pennsylvania. Hardest hit is Montgomery County, with 18 cases. Cases announced Friday included the first two children under 18. Chester County saw its first case, as did two counties west of the Susquehanna River: Cumberland County with three and Washington County with one.The confirmed cases largely have been traced back to contact with the new coronavirus in another state or country. Most people are at home in isolation, officials say; a few are hospitalized.For most people, the new coronavirus causes only mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia, and death.The vast majority of people recover.___MONTGOMERY AND DELAWARE COUNTIESWolf has said his shutdown order will be continually evaluated and could spread to other counties. It also applies to higher education, gyms, child day cares and adult care centers.His administration said Wolf was acting under disaster emergency law that allows him to control movement and occupancy in a disaster area, but it could not say when a governor had last used that power. It also cited the Department of Health\\'s legal responsibility to \"determine and employ the most efficient and practical means for the prevention and suppression of disease.\"Gas stations, grocery stores, pharmacies, government facilities, utilities and mass transit should continue to operate, he said, while no-visitor policies are to be adopted by prisons and nursing homes.___CANCELLATIONSPublic programs, events and training in Pennsylvania\\'s state parks and forests were canceled Friday through April, although parks and forests will remain open except for three parks in the Philadelphia suburb of Montgomery County. The event cancellations include special events such as races and festivals.Visitors can still camp overnight or stay in cabins and cottages, and fishing is still allowed. In Montgomery County, three state parks will be closed to visitors for at least two weeks: Evansburg, Fort Washington and Norristown Farm Park.___PRISON VISITSThe state Department of Corrections has canceled all visits with inmates for two weeks and said it will step up screening of employees and vendors, including taking temperatures and asking a series of questions.Anyone with flu-like symptoms or a temperature of 100.4 degrees or more will not be allowed in a state prison, Corrections Secretary John Wetzel said in a statement.There are no confirmed cases in state prisons.___LAWMAKERSPennsylvania state lawmakers plan to return to voting session on Monday with COVID-19 response at the top of their agenda.A House Republican majority spokesman said Friday that coronavirus-related legislation could include health-care access, insurance, health emergency declarations, workplace protection and funding.Lawmakers and the governor\\'s office plan to meet over the weekend to sort out details.'"

       "'Capitol Notebook by Spotlight PA provides updates on important news and notes from the halls of power in Harrisburg. Sign up for our weekly newsletter.  No one has tested positive for the new coronavirus in Pennsylvania, but the state’s health secretary said Wednesday preparations are underway to deal with the “very serious health issue.”  “Since the start of this outbreak, we’ve taken a proactive approach to prepare and carefully monitor the health and safety of Pennsylvanians that were returning from China,” Department of Health Secretary Rachel Levine said at a Capitol press conference. “It is critical now that we be prepared for the possibility of community spread of COVID-19.”  There are more than 80,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 worldwide, according to the World Health Organization. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention expects that number to rise and is urging the public to act to prevent the spread of the virus, which has caused 2,700 deaths worldwide but none so far in the U.S.  “We are asking the American public to work with us to prepare in the expectation that this could be bad,” Nancy Messonnier, director of the CDC’s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Diseases, said Tuesday.  The Wolf administration has activated the Department of Health’s enhanced response coordination, is monitoring symptoms of those who have recently traveled to China, is educating businesses and schools, and has updated the flu plan for coronavirus, according to a Wednesday statement.  “We are not discussing the number of cases that we are monitoring,” Levine said. “We are following all of the CDC guidelines, but we are not going to cover specific numbers now. If there is a case of COVID-19, we will inform the public.”  Symptoms of the virus can include fever, cough, and shortness of breath, and can appear two to 14 days after the initial exposure. Some people carry the virus and can spread it, but do not show any symptoms.  “This coronavirus is somewhat more contagious than influenza and it seems it can lead to more deaths than influenza,” Levine said, noting that there is conflicting international data.  Levine said the state is prepared with “stores of personal protective equipment.” If those supplies were depleted by community spread, the state would have to rely on federal supplies.  “Any lab testing in Pennsylvania is done at the CDC [in Atlanta], but we at the state Department of Health have labs ready to do quality testing,” Levine said, adding that the department is waiting for the CDC to send replacement test kits to replace faulty ones. The CDC has not said when new kits will arrive.  The CDC can deliver test results within 24 to 48 hours, Levine said, assuming there is no backlog.  Worldwide, there are already efforts underway to create a vaccine. Scientists from Philadelphia’s Wistar Institute and Plymouth Meeting-based Inovio Pharmaceuticals are working to deliver a vaccine that will be ready within months, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer.  The highly contagious virus has already had a chilling effect in parts of the state and has halted trips to and from China.  “I would like to reassure you that the Pennsylvania Department of Health and our stakeholders are prepared for any spread of COVID-19,” Levine said.

       "'Pennsylvania’s health department is preparing for the expected arrival of COVID-19, the disease caused by coronavirus.  The respiratory virus—marked by fever, cough and shortness of breath—has already sickened 81,000 people and killed 2,700 people worldwide.  There are 57 U.S. residents with the virus, including about 40 who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess cruise ship, said Department of Health Secretary Doctor Rachel Levine.  Nobody has had it in Pennsylvania, but the state expects that to change, and is bracing for “community spread” of the virus, Levine said.  “It seems to be more communicable than influenza and it seems to lead to a higher fatality rate than influenza,” she said, adding that older people and those with others serious medical problems are those most at risk for serious complications.  The health department’s emergency operations center is monitoring people who returned from China for symptoms, Levine said. She declined to say how many people the center is monitoring.  The health department will notify the public if there are any confirmed cases, she said. A person could be infected for up to two weeks before they show symptoms.  The state has stockpiles of protective equipment for medical workers and is seeking additional resources from the federal government, Levine said.  She recommended that people follow guidelines on the state’s family emergency plan and follow basic precautions for preventing the spread of diseases.  “Pennsylvanians should continue to help stop the spread of viruses by washing your hands, covering coughs and sneezes, cleaning surfaces and staying home if you are sick.”'"

       "'PITTSBURGH (KDKA) – The Centers for Disease Control says it’s not a question of if, but when coronavirus starts to spread in the United States. Local officials are preparing for the possibility by outlining plans and educating the public.  The CDC expects more cases of the coronavirus to be confirmed in the U.S. in the coming days and weeks.  “No one in Pennsylvania has tested positive for COVID-19,” said Pennsylvania’s Secretary of Health Dr. Rachel Levine on Wednesday.  CLICK HERE: Pennsylvania Health Department Coronavirus Resources  However, Dr. Levine said Governor Wolf isn’t taking any chances. While no one has died from the virus in the U.S., there are 57 cases nationwide. The CDC is concerned that the virus could spread across the country.  “We have provided symptom monitoring for residents of Pennsylvania returning from China. We have provided health care professionals, businesses and educational settings,” said Levine. Plus, she said the state is stocked up on supplies.  The state health department created a web page of information to educate the public about coronavirus. It lays out the symptoms of COVID-19 — fever, coughing, shortness of breath — and how coronavirus spreads — just like the cold or flu.  According to the state health department, the symptoms may appear in as few as two days or as long as two weeks after exposure. People with the illness report a range of little to no symptoms or being severely ill and dying.  The state health department says the virus can spread through the air by coughing and sneezing or through close personal contact. It can also be contracted by touching something with the virus on it.  As far as prevention goes, Levine said it’s as simple as washing your hands, using an alcohol-based hand sanitizer and covering coughs and sneezes. She said the coronavirus is known to be more contagious and will lead to more deaths than the flu. If you’re sick, the state health department advises you to stay home until you feel better.  When it comes to wearing a mask, the state health department says it’s not recommended outside of workplaces settings. They say a person-to-person spread usually happens within 6 feet and that the devices need to be available to health care workers and other people who need them.  The CDC recommends that travelers avoid all “nonessential” trips to China and South Korea. As for traveling other places outside of the country, the state health department recommends checking with the CDC.  CLICK HERE: Allegheny County Health Department Coronavirus Resources  The Allegheny County Health Department is urging businesses to also start prepping for what could come. There is a shortage of surgical masks and the N95 respirator. KDKA called multiple pharmacies around Pittsburgh and they were all out. Amazon isn’t an option either. The respirator is listed as currently unavailable.  Allegheny County Health Department says it has “daily” communication with both state and federal health agencies about staying proactive in the face of the coronavirus outbreak. They are also monitoring the situation closely and working with local hospitals, clinics and Pittsburgh International Airport.  At the start of the year, Pittsburgh Public Safety Director Wendell Hissrich began holding regular meetings to plan for the possibility of coronavirus in the city.  CLICK HERE: Pittsburgh Public Safety Prepares For Coronavirus Outbreak  Part of Public Safety’s readiness plan includes updating the city’s 2014 Pandemic operational plan. During the update, contingency plans were added to ensure there would be enough first responders if necessary.  The city’s first responders have also been trained to identify possible cases of coronavirus and were given “enhanced personal protection kits” that include face masks, gloves, hand sanitizers and protective eyewear.  Hospitals are preparing, focusing on screening for coronavirus.  Currently, the procedure for someone coming to the emergency room with a cough, fever or flu-like symptoms is to first get a mask, and then at the check-in desk, they’ll be asked questions about travel. If there’s any possibility of COVID-19, they’re brought directly back to an isolation room.  Hospitalized patients with COVID-19 would be admitted to airborn isolation rooms.  Even on a smaller scale, local institution like colleges are preparing for coronavirus, some going as far as canceling study abroad programs.  Robert Morris University is canceling all of its faculty-led study abroad programs out of an abundance of caution as the coronavirus continues to spread. In a letter to students, faculty and staff, RMU says that study abroad programs for the rest of the spring semester and those scheduled in May will be canceled.  Meanwhile, the University of Pittsburgh says they’re monitoring coronavirus across the world and at this time, they don’t anticipate making changes to summer study abroad programs outside of China. Pitt notes that no final decisions have been made.  Dr. Amesh Adalja, who specializes in infectious diseases and pandemic preparedness, spoke to students and faculty from several universities in the Oakland area about the ongoing coronavirus outbreak.  “Right now in the United States, you are more likely to get influenza in the coronavirus,” he said. “The number of cases is still low and we are still in the flu season.”  While there is a mask shortage, Dr. Adalja says: “The general public does not need to wear a mask right now and it’s actually taking the supply away which we need for hospitals and sick patients.”  There have been no confirmed coronavirus cases reported in Pennsylvania.'"

Officials stopped short of predicting how many people will fall seriously ill but did say that the reported surge in cases outside of China has prompted the warning.

       "'HARRISBURG, Pa. (WHTM) — A Pennsylvania-native is back in the Midstate after his family has been ripped apart by the coronavirus. His father-in-law died from the disease. His wife, who is recovering from it, is stuck in China.  Frank Wucinski and his three-year-old daughter Annabel went through weeks of quarantine. They feel fine physically, but emotionally, it’s never been harder.  “Where’s mommy?” Wucinski asked.  “Mommy’s in Wuhan,” Annabel quietly replied.  Annabel’s mom is Li Qiong. She is recovering from the disease, which has more than 82,000 confirmed cases across the globe.  The Wucinski family lived in Guangzhou, China, but were in Wuhan for a funeral, when they found themselves stuck in the middle of a global health crisis.  “They started shutting everything down and hospitals started getting overcrowded. We decided then we had to get Annabel out of the city,” Wucinksi said.  So Wucinski started working with the U.S. embassy to get to Pennsylvania. After weeks without seeing daylight and in isolation, he and Annabel are now staying with family in the Harrisburg-area.  “My father-in-law tested positive for the virus, so my wife had to stay and take care of him, but also at the same time, she was sick,” Wucinski said.  Qiong’s father ended up dying but she is recovering. Her most recent test came back negative for coronavirus.  The situation has left Annabel confused about why she can’t be with her mother.  “She’ll start saying she’s scared of mommy and I’ll ask why and she says because mommy’s mad at her,” Wucinski said.  Wucinski says by the time his wife finishes all required isolation and travel returns to normal, the soonest the family may be reunited is April.  “We’re waiting for flights to start up again for the city to get off lockdown,” he said.  The Wucinski family’s health insurance is in China, and bills for their precautionary stays in America are already adding up.  They started a GoFundMe to help with the costs of flights and necessities.  “We can’t access any of my bank accounts in China. Chinese bank accounts only issue one bank card per account, so I left that with my wife,” Wucinski said.  Wucinski has been working from home and video-chatting his wife regularly.  He says he doesn’t see his family returning to China unless they come up with some sort of a vaccine.'"

More people will get to choose, oldest to youngest. If we get a choice, we are staying put unless we get more information. We have everything but a window and when we want to see outside, we have a video feed.  They went overboard on Valentine’s Day: a red rose, candy, health and beauty items, special meals, and desserts. The captain said the items were donated by some local people. How nice. We also saw a moving video made by some elementary school kids.  The internet is bad again and TV is in the tank again. Boo.  During our walk today, people seemed much more relaxed and optimistic. Maybe it’s Stockholm syndrome. Or resignation. Or Valentine’s chocolate.  We had a health check. They tried to ask us about preexisting conditions, we think. Language was a real problem.  Later: The captain just reported that there may be plans for the U.S. government to fly us out. A Wall Street Journal article is saying that the government is planning to ship us to Texas or California for two weeks of quarantine. If so, why now? We have been exposed at least since Jan. 14. I will be happy to be on U.S. soil. But I want Pennsylvania soil!  Later: It’s 1:46 a.m. here. I want to sleep but I’m unable. This nightmare seems to be ending. We keep telling each other that all be OK but being at the epicenter of a possible pandemic, hearing the death count rise — it has affected us significantly. Getting on that plane tomorrow cannot happen soon enough. Hopefully we’ll be home in Dillsburg in early March.'"

       "'The Pennsylvania Department of Health expects to be running its own tests for the new coronavirus by Friday. But the department will continue forwarding tests to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for confirmation, said April Hutcheson, a spokeswoman for the department.  That means results will still come slower than some infectious disease specialists consider optimal.  State testing labs across the country have been without a test for the new coronavirus as a result of problems with test kits initially provided by the CDC. States been forwarding samples from people who may have the new coronavirus to a CDC lab in Atlanta and waiting up to 48 hours for results.  The CDC said it would resume providing test kits early this week.  As a result of being able to test samples at the state’s lab near Philadelphia, Hutcheson said, “We gain time. We gain the ability to activate a response more quickly.”  And with the CDC now having only to confirm positive samples rather than perform all the tests, the turnaround time for receiving results should shrink, she said.  The symptoms of the new coronavirus — fever, cough, difficulty breathing — are similar to those of the regular flu.  Some experts say it’s important for hospitals to be able to do their own tests, which could dramatically reduce the wait for results. They say that’s key to preventing spread of the coronavirus, since local health care providers could quickly take steps to isolate the sick person and begin tracing the person’s contacts to find other possible infections. A fast test would further help doctors know what treatment the patient needs.  Federal officials over the weekend also said they would grant emergency permission to hospital-based labs and commercial labs to create their own tests.  Hutcheson as of early Monday afternoon said the health department was focused on getting its own testing up and running, and didn’t know if tests would soon be available at hospitals and commercial labs in Pennsylvania.  Asked about the availability of hospital-based tests on Monday, a UPMC Pinnacle spokeswoman said, “As of right now UPMC is working with our partners at the state Department of Health for our testing needs.”  A spokeswoman for Penn State Health Milton S. Hershey Medical Center said, “We are not currently doing any testing at [the medical center] and will defer to the DOH as to when testing will be available in Pennsylvania.”  Hutcheson said privacy laws prevented her from discussing how many samples of possible coronavirus infections Pennsylvania has forwarded to the CDC. She stressed that Pennsylvania as of early Monday afternoon had no confirmed cases.  As soon as there is a confirmed case in Pennsylvania, the public will be notified, she said.  Nationally, there were about 80 coronavirus cases in the United States and six deaths as of Monday afternoon.  Pennsylvania health officials believe it’s only a matter of time before people in Pennsylvania get the coronavirus and spread it to others. Hutcheson noted it has now been found in several states close to Pennsylvania, including New York.  “We are prepared for community spread,” she said. “No one has a crystal ball. We wish we did … There is no way to forecast when this virus will hit. But we can begin thinking about what our reaction will be and that’s what we’re doing right now.”'"

       "'HARRISBURG, PA — Pennsylvania state health officials are preparing after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued a dire warning Tuesday, saying communities across the nation should prepare now for the spread of COVID-19, the new coronavirus.  Dr. Nancy Messonnier, the director of the CDC\\'s National Center for Immunization and Respiratory Disease, told reporters in a conference call the question is no longer if the coronavirus, now officially called COVID-19, will spread across the United States but when that will happen.  Communities, schools and businesses in Pennsylvania and elsewhere should begin preparing now for \"the expectation that this could be bad,\" Messonnier said.  \"I understand this whole situation may seem overwhelming and that disruption to everyday life may be severe. But these are things that people need to start thinking about now,\" she said. \"You should think about what you would do for child care if schools or day cares closed.\"  To date, no one in Pennsylvania has tested positive for COVID-19, state health officials confirmed Tuesday. But state officials say they\\'re preparing for a spread of the disease across the community.  \"As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advised today, we need to be prepared for community spread of COVID-19. We are working to make sure our health systems, first responders and county and municipal health departments have the resources they need to respond,\" Pennsylvania Secretary of Health Rachel Levine said.    \"We know through our work with CDC in planning for disease outbreaks that it is best to prepare now.\" Levine said.  So far in Pennsylvania, officials have activated the Department of Health\\'s Emergency Operations Center to allow for enhanced response coordination. Symptom monitoring has been done for residents returning to Pennsylvania from China.  Additionally, the state has reviewed and adapted current pandemic flu plans for COVID-19.  Globally, at least 80,000 people have been infected and 2,700 people have died from the new coronavirus, creating a global pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. It is spreading so quickly overseas that infectious disease experts and scientists warn there may be no way to contain it.  As of Tuesday, 57 cases of COVID-19 have been confirmed in the United States, according to Levine.    Three dozen of the patients in the United States diagnosed with the disease are among passengers repatriated from the Diamond Princess cruise ship quarantined for weeks off the coast of Japan; three patients were infected in Wuhan, China, the center of the outbreak, and the others contracted the virus while traveling abroad.  World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a news conference Monday the \"sudden increase in new cases\" outside of China is \"deeply concerning.\"  The symptoms of the new coronavirus are similar to seasonal influenza, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine. Both are infectious respiratory illnesses, but they\\'re caused by different viruses.  Both cause fever, cough, body aches and fatigue, and can result in pneumonia. Both illnesses can sometimes cause vomiting and diarrhea. Both can be spread from person to person by sneezing, coughing or talking.  Common good-health practices such as frequent hand-washing, covering coughs and staying home from work or school during the course of the illness can help control the spread of both illnesses.  Neither responds to antibiotic treatment, but both may be treated by addressing symptoms, such as reducing fever. Both illnesses can be severe enough to require hospitalization.  But there are some distinct differences between the two:  Flu is caused by several different types of viruses, while COVID-19 is caused by the new coronavirus, which is also called severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, or SARS-CoV-2.  Johns Hopkins says there is some evidence COVID-19 could be airborne, \"meaning that tiny droplets remaining in the air could cause disease in others even after the ill person is no longer near.\"  There is no vaccine to protect against the new coronavirus, as there is against influenza. Scientists around the world are racing to find a vaccine for the new coronavirus, although none currently exists.
